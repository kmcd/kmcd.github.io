   <p>= Questions</p>
<p>What anti-patterns do MS display?<br />
What are the most applicable chapters?<br />
What types of tests are we missing?<br />
Best acceptance test framework?<br />
What is the current MS deployement pipeline?<br />
What is the optimum deployement pipeline?<br />
Can we have a zero down time release?<br />
Is a blue green deployment realistic?<br />
Can we effectively roll back data changed by a release?</p>
<p>= Chapter 1 Problem</p>
<p>= Release anti-patterns</p>
<p>Antipattern: Deploying Software Manually</p>
<p>• The production of extensive, detailed documentation that describes the steps to be taken and the ways in which the steps may go wrong<br />
• Reliance on manual testing to confirm that the application is running correctly<br />
• Frequent calls to the development team to explain why a deployment is going wrong on a release day<br />
• Frequent corrections to the release process during the course of a release<br />
• Environments in a cluster that differ in their configuration<br />
• Releases that take more than a few minutes to perform<br />
• Releases that are unpredictable in their outcome, that often have to be rolled back or run into unforeseen problems</p>
<p>Antipattern: Deploying to a Production-like Environment Only after Development Is Complete</p>
<p>Antipattern: Manual Configuration Management of Production Environments</p>
<p>Feedback is essential to frequent, automated releases. There are three criteria<br />
for feedback to be useful.<br />
• Any change, of whatever kind, needs to trigger the feedback process.<br />
• The feedback must be delivered as soon as possible.<br />
• The delivery team must receive feedback and then act on it.</p>
<p>Typical tests<br />
• The software’s unit tests must pass.<br />
• test coverage and other technology-specific metrics.<br />
• business acceptance criteria—that it delivers the business value that was intended.<br />
• capacity, availability, security,<br />
• exploratory testing and a demonstration</p>
<p>Principles<br />
Create a Repeatable, Reliable Process for Releasing Software<br />
Automate Almost Everything<br />
Keep Everything in Version Control<br />
If It Hurts, Do It More Frequently, and Bring the Pain Forward<br />
Build Quality In (catch defects as early in the delivery process as possible)<br />
Done Means Released</p>
<p>= Chapter 3 Continuous Integration</p>
<p>Keep the Build and Test Process Short</p>
