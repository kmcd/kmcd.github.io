<p>= Notes</p>
<p>== Audience &amp; objectives</p>
<p>Understanding Search Engine Traffic and Visitor Intent As we discussed in<br />
“The Mission of Search Engines” on page 2 in Chapter 1, searchers enter<br />
many different types of searches. These are typically classified into three<br />
major categories of activity:</p>
<p>Navigational query This is a query with the intent to arrive at a specific<br />
website or page (e.g., the person types in your company name, Acme Device<br />
Co.).  Informational query This is a search performed to receive an answer<br />
to a broad or direct question with no specific source in mind (e.g., Celtics<br />
game score).  Transactional query A person who types in digital camera may<br />
be looking to buy one now, but it is more likely that she is researching<br />
digital cameras. This is an example of an initial transactional query, which<br />
can evolve in stages. For example, here are some other types of transactional<br />
queries that occur at a later stage in the buying cycle: • The user types<br />
in buy digital camera. Although there is no information in the query about<br />
which one she wants to buy, the intent still seems quite clear.  • The<br />
searcher types in canon powershot G10. The chances are very high that this<br />
user is looking to buy that particular camera.</p>
<p>What products, services, and types of information and resources does your<br />
organization have to offer?</p>
<p>Does your company need direct sales, traffic, branding, or some combination<br />
of these?  <br />
• Are there specific influencers you’re trying to reach<br />
with a message?  <br />
• Is the organization/brand subject to potentially<br />
negative material that needs to be controlled/mitigated?  <br />
• Do you have products/services you sell, either directly over the Web or through leads<br />
established online?</p>
<p>== Keyword research</p>
<p>70% in the long tail</p>
<p>1. Produce a list of key one- to three-word phrases that describe your<br />
products/services.  <br />
2. Spend some time coming up with synonyms that your<br />
potential customers might use for those products and services. Use a<br />
thesaurus to help you with this process.  <br />
3. Create a taxonomy of all the<br />
areas of focus in your industry. It can be helpful to imagine creating a<br />
directory for all the people, projects, ideas, and companies connected to<br />
your site. You can also look at sites that are leaders in the industry and<br />
study their site hierarchy as a way to start your thinking about a taxonomy.<br />
4. Broaden your list by thinking of higher-level terms of which your products<br />
or services are a subset.  <br />
5. Review your existing site, and extract what<br />
appear to be key phrases from your site. <br />
6. Review industry association<br />
and/or media sites to see what phrases they use to discuss your topic area.<br />
7. List all your various brand terms.  <br />
8. List all your products. If your<br />
site has a massive number of products, consider stepping back a level (or<br />
two) and listing the categories and subcategories. <br />
9. Have your team step<br />
back and imagine they are a potential customer, and ask them what they would<br />
type into a search engine if they were looking for something similar to your<br />
product or service. <br />
10. Supplement this by asking some people outside your<br />
business what they would search for, preferably people who are not directly<br />
associated with the company.  <br />
11. Use your web analytics tool to see what<br />
terms people are already using to come to your site.</p>
<p>(reminds me of Steve Blanks approach)</p>
<p>Competitors 1. Review your competitors’ websites and see what key phrases<br />
they use for their products and services that compete with yours.  2. Record<br />
what nonbrand terms they use for their business.  3. Read any articles they<br />
have written that are published on sites other than their own.  4. Observe<br />
what the media may have had to say about them.</p>
<p>Search results count (is this data reliable?)  Use related search command<br />
to come up with terms you may have missed</p>
<p>Using a search with the * character can give you a good idea of what<br />
terms/phrases commonly precede or follow a given term/phrase. For example,<br />
using * ringtones can show you phrases that are commonly associated with<br />
the term ringtone</p>
<p>Using the very cool Google date range operator, shown in Figure 5-5, you<br />
can determine how many times in the past day, week, month, or year your term<br />
has appeared.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TABLE</span> 5-1. Google date search operators could be useful for scripting</p>
<p>Traffic estimator != Keyword tool</p>
<p>he AdWords Keyword Tool offers a lot of useful information about your<br />
keyword campaigns, such as suggestions for similar keywords, an estimate of<br />
the keyword’s popularity, ad costs and positions, general search volume<br />
trend information, and keyword campaign suggestions for your site or your<br />
competitor’s site.</p>
<p>The Traffic Estimator provides a decent estimate of your keyword’s<br />
click-through rate. Based on the estimated clicks per day, you can get<br />
a relative idea of which of your keywords are the most popular and can<br />
potentially bring you the most traffic.</p>
<p>When using the Traffic Estimator for keyword research it is best to enter<br />
your keywords as “exact match” for direct comparison.</p>
<p>Misspellings Google trends: not applicable to long tail kewywords</p>
<p>Identifying relevant keywords How relevant is the term/phrase to the content,<br />
services, products, or information on your site?  It is a good idea to<br />
target keywords that indicate imminent action (e.g., buy cranium board<br />
game, best prices for honda civic), because searchers are more likely to<br />
perform the corresponding action on your site when they search for those<br />
terms than they are for terms such as honda civic or cranium board game.<br />
How many people who search for this term will come to your site and leave<br />
dissatisfied? (abandonment rate)</p>
<p>Run a <span class="caps">PPC</span> campaign (full coverage) for a more accurate estimate of search<br />
volume</p>
<p>text-mining relevant documents on the subject of your industry/service/product<br />
for terms that, although lower in search volume, have a reasonable degree<br />
of relation.</p>
<p>1. Extract the top 10 to 50 most common search phrases at the head of the<br />
distribution graph from your existing keyword research in the industry.<br />
2. Search Google, Yahoo!, and Bing for each term.  3. For each page in the<br />
top 10 to 30 results, extract the unique usable text on the page.  4. Remove<br />
stop words and filter by phrase size.  5. Remove instances of terms/phrases<br />
already in your keyword research database.  6. Sort through the most common<br />
remnants first, and comb as far down as you feel is valuable.</p>
<p>You can expand on this method in the following ways: • Text-mine Technorati<br />
or Delicious for relevant results.  • Use documents purely from specific<br />
types of results—local, academic—to focus your keyword mining efforts.<br />
• Mine forum threads on your subject matter. You could even use inurl:forum<br />
in the searches to grab conversational keywords.</p>
<p>N.B. This methodology is highly effective. The return on this research has a<br />
direct relationship to the amount of effort you expend (and how deep you dig).</p>
<p>The best approach is to use the long tail research techniques we discussed in<br />
this chapter and identify the major patterns, or the major words that appear<br />
across different long tail scenarios, and then work those words into your copy.</p>
<p>Authority “DiscoWeb: Applying Link Analysis to Web Search”<br />
(http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/pubs/1999/www8/), became the basis of the<br />
Teoma algorithm,</p>
<p>The model of organizing the Web into topical communities and pinpointing<br />
the hubs and authorities is an important model to understand (read<br />
more about it in Mike Grehan’s paper, “Filthy Linking Rich!” at<br />
http://www.search-engine-book.co.uk/filthy_linking_rich.pdf). The best link<br />
builders understand this model and leverage it to their benefit.</p>
<p>TrustRank The trust level of a site would be based on how many clicks away<br />
it is from seed (trusted sites selected by hand) sites.</p>
<p>mozTrust from SEOmoz’s Linkscape is the only publicly available measured<br />
estimation of a page’s TrustRank.</p>
<p>Google has publicly indicated that it starts its crawl in PageRank order.</p>
<p>Putting together a link campaign generally starts with researching sites<br />
that would potentially link to the publisher’s site and then determining<br />
the relative value of each potential linker.</p>
<p>Determining a links value: The PageRank of the home page of the site<br />
providing the link. Note that Google does not publish a site’s PageRank,<br />
just the PageRank for individual pages. It is common among <span class="caps">SEO</span> practitioners<br />
to use the home page of a site as a proxy for the site’s overall PageRank,<br />
since a site’s home page typically garners the most links. You can also<br />
use the Domain mozRank from SEOmoz’s Linkscape tool to get a third-party<br />
approximation of domain PageRank.  • The perceived authority of the<br />
site. Although there is a relationship between authority and PageRank, they<br />
do not have a 1:1 relationship. Authority relates to how the sites in a given<br />
market space are linked to by other significant sites in the same market space,<br />
whereas PageRank measures aggregate raw link value without regard to the<br />
market space.  So, higher-authority sites will tend to have higher PageRank,<br />
but this is not absolutely the case.  • The PageRank of the linking page.<br />
• The perceived authority of the linking page.  • The number of outbound<br />
links on the linking page. This is important because the linking page can<br />
vote its passable PageRank for the pages to which it links, but each page<br />
it links o consumes a portion of that PageRank, leaving less to be passed<br />
on to other pages. This can be expressed mathematically as follows: For a<br />
page with passable PageRank n and with r outbound links: Passed PageRank =<br />
n/r This is a rough formula, but the bottom line is that the more outbound<br />
links a page has, the less valuable a link from that page will be.  • The<br />
relevance of the linking page and the site.</p>
<p>Link factors: 3. Something on your site triggered an emotional reaction<br />
from the publisher, causing it to link to your site. For example, perhaps<br />
your site had the funniest cartoon the publisher ever saw, or it offered an<br />
inflammatory political opinion.  4. The publisher may see something of value<br />
on your site and wants its site visitors to know about it. The majority of the<br />
highest-value links are given for this reason.  5. A business relationship<br />
comes into play. For example, you may have a network of distributors and<br />
resellers for your product. Do they all link back to you?</p>
<p>Creating emotional reactions can result in links • Create quality reference<br />
material. Providing unique and powerful information to users can be a<br />
great way to get links, particularly if you can make sure the publishers of<br />
authoritative sites in your market space learn about what you have created,<br />
including why it would be of value to their website visitors.  • Leverage<br />
business relationships. In our example, we suggested that you might be someone<br />
who has a network of resellers. If this is your business model, having a link<br />
back to you as a standard term in your reseller agreement is sound business.</p>
<p>identify the link-building targets and what content will most resonate with<br />
the publisher of the target sites, and then tweak the content plan accordingly</p>
<p>Use content that helps establish your site as a leading expert on its topic<br />
matter. When you produce really high-quality stuff, it builds trust with the<br />
user community and increases your chances of getting links.  • Minimize<br />
the commercial nature of the content pages.  Do not disguise the relationship<br />
between the content and the commercial part of your site.</p>
<p>provide the content to another site in return for a link to its site.<br />
Social media</p>
<p>Blogs</p>
<p>Identify types of sites that might link to a site like yours Some example<br />
types of target sites include: • Noncompeting sites in your market space •<br />
Major media sites • Bloggers • Universities and colleges • Government<br />
sites • Sites that link to your competitors • Related hobbyist sites<br />
Make sure you take the time to answer the question “why would these sites<br />
link to us?” Think broadly here, and don’t limit the possible answers<br />
based on your current site. In other words, perhaps you can create some new<br />
content that would be compelling to one or more of your target groups.</p>
<p>Find out where your competitors get links Simply use tools such as  Linkscape,<br />
Majestic-<span class="caps">SEO</span>, or Link Diagnosis, each of which will give you a list of the<br />
sites that link to your competitors.</p>
<p>Once you have that data, look at the most powerful links they have (as<br />
measured by PageRank or mozRank/mozTrust) to identify opportunities for your<br />
site. Perhaps they have received great links from national media or a set<br />
of government sites. By seeing what has worked for them, you can get ideas<br />
on what may work for you.</p>
<p>One key aspect of this is that the content needs to be unique and<br />
differentiated.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you will want to build a road map that provides you with a sense<br />
of what it would cost to chase a potential group of linkers and the value<br />
of each group of linkers.</p>
<p>Identify methods for contacting potential linkers You must undertake some<br />
activities to let potential linkers know about your site. There are two major<br />
categories of methods: direct and indirect. Some examples of direct contact<br />
methods include: • Email • Social media sites, using the messaging features<br />
of a social media property to make contact with potential linkers • Content<br />
syndication (contacting people and offering them great article content for<br />
placement on their site) • Blogger networking (building relationships by<br />
commenting on others’ blogs, writing content intended to be of interest<br />
to them, and letting them know about it) Some examples of indirect methods<br />
include: • Social media campaigns (including Digg, Propeller, Delicious,<br />
StumbleUpon, and others) • PR • News feeds (through Yahoo! News and<br />
Google News)</p>
<p>Link bait ideas 1. Write down everything.  Just collect any and all ideas<br />
that come to mind. Do not censor or edit yourself during this phase; take<br />
down every idea no matter how bizarre, idiotic, or farfetched it may sound.<br />
2. Break down your ideas.  Once you’ve squeezed every last drop of creative<br />
juice from your head, it is time to filter everything out. It is a good idea<br />
to break down each idea (no censoring or editing yet) into its Concept and<br />
Content components. That is, what is the format (Concept) for the suggested<br />
link bait (tool, widget, top 10 list, how-to guide, blog post, etc.) versus<br />
what is the subject (Content) of the suggested link bait (Wii, iPod, <span class="caps">PPC</span> ads,<br />
pigs, celebrity weddings, etc.)? Separate these into two lists.  3. Evaluate<br />
the content.  Ignoring your Concept list, critically evaluate your Content<br />
list. Are some ideas time- sensitive? Can some wait for a relevant piece<br />
of news to complement them? Are there ideas you’d really like to write<br />
about? Are there ideas that can go into storage for a dry spell?</p>
<p>10, how-to, and so on. Can it be interactive? Perhaps a tool or poll<br />
concept would be effective. By marrying your priority content to the most<br />
appropriate concept, you can optimize the effectiveness, reach, and novelty<br />
to your intended audience.  If you use this process or something similar,<br />
you’ll probably notice that you quickly generate a handy repertoire of<br />
concepts. Once you have these down, you can turn virtually any random idea<br />
that pops into your head into link bait.</p>
<p>Incentive-Based Link Marketing</p>
<p>Helping Other Sites Boost Their Value you can consider picking out the top<br />
10 sites related to your space. Then you can send these sites an award badge<br />
with a link to a review that lives on your site.</p>
<p>Another example is various forms of certification. For example, Google has<br />
badges for its AdWords Qualified Professionals and AdWords Qualified Companies,<br />
with links back to Google.</p>
<p>Blogging for Links at least two to three times per week (maybe more)</p>
<p>One of the best places to get links to a blog is from other blogs. This is<br />
best done by targeting relationships with major bloggers and earning their<br />
trust and respect. Here are a few key things to think about when building<br />
these relationships: • Be patient when developing relationships with other<br />
bloggers. Trust and respect do not come overnight. And they certainly do not<br />
result from starting the relationship with a request for a link.  • The<br />
publisher should target a portion of its content at the interests of the<br />
major bloggers.  • Over time, this process should turn into links to the<br />
publisher’s blog from the major bloggers.  • Other lesser-known bloggers<br />
will begin to see links on the major blogs and will begin to follow suit.</p>
<p>67.3% of people found what blogs to read by following links from other blogs.</p>
<p>Publishers just launching a blog should try to provide a personalized<br />
response to every person who comments on their blog. One effective way to<br />
do this is to send each and every one of them a personalized response by<br />
email that shows that the comment was read.</p>
<p>Leveraging Social News and Tagging Sites (Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Delicious<br />
&#8230; )</p>
<p>If you create articles for social news sites such as Digg, Reddit, and<br />
Propeller, focus on topics that relate to keywords relevant to your business.</p>
<p>The key insight into how to make that happen is to use the competitive keyword<br />
in the title of the article itself and in the title of the submission of<br />
the article to the social news site.</p>
<p>Tagging sites are best used in attempting to reach and develop credit with<br />
major influencers in a market space.</p>
<p>Offline Relationship Building</p>
<p>“Build great stuff, tell everyone about it, and motivate them to share.”</p>
<p>== <span class="caps">SEO</span> research</p>
<p>Competitor analysis</p>
<p>1. Start with a simple business analysis to see how a particular company’s<br />
business overlaps with yours and with other top-ranked sites in your market<br />
space. It is good to know who is competing directly and who is competing<br />
only indirectly.  2. Find out the starting year for the website. This can<br />
be helpful in evaluating the site’s momentum. Determining the domain age<br />
is easy; you can do it by checking the domain’s Whois records. Obtaining<br />
the age of the site is trickier. However, you can use the Wayback Machine<br />
(http://www.archive.org) to get an idea of when a site was launched (or at<br />
least when it had enough exposure that Archive.org started tracking it).<br />
3. Determine the number of Google results for a search for the domain<br />
name (including the extension) for the past six months, excluding<br />
the domain itself. To get this information, search for theirdomain.com<br />
-site:theirdomain.com in Google. Then append as_qdr=m6 to the end of the<br />
results page <span class="caps">URL</span> and reload the page.  4. Determine the number of Google<br />
results for a search for the domain name (including the extension) for<br />
the past three months, excluding the domain itself. This time modify the<br />
results page <span class="caps">URL</span> by adding &amp;as_qdr=m3 to the end of it.  5. Perform a query<br />
on Google Blog Search (http://blogsearch.google.com/) for the domain name,<br />
excluding the domain itself, on the default settings (no particular timeline).<br />
6. Find out from Google Blog Search how many posts have appeared about the site<br />
in the past month. To do this, search for the domain in Google Blog Search,<br />
but then append &amp;as_qdr=m1 to the end of the results page <span class="caps">URL</span> and reload the<br />
page.  7. Obtain the PageRank of the domain’s home page as reported by the<br />
Google Toolbar.  8. Use Yahoo! Site Explorer to determine how many backlinks<br />
the site has. Better still is if you have an industrial-strength tool such<br />
as SEOmoz’s Linkscape (http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape) or Majestic-<span class="caps">SEO</span><br />
(http://www.majesticseo.com). These tools provide a much richer set of link<br />
data based on their own crawl of the Web, including additional critical<br />
details such as the anchor text of the links.  9. Pull a traffic chart<br />
from Compete (http://www.compete.com) that compares the site’s traffic to<br />
that of its direct competitors to see how it is doing trafficwise. Repeat<br />
the traffic analysis with Quantcast (http://www.quantcast.com) and Alexa<br />
(http://www.alexa.com). Be careful to not put too much stock in the specific<br />
numbers, as the measurement techniques of these services are crude, but the<br />
relative traffic numbers should be information of great interest (e.g.,<br />
competitor A is doing better than competitor B and how they both compare<br />
to you).  10. If you are able to access a paid service such as Hitwise<br />
(http://www.hitwise.com) or comScore (http://www.comscore.com), you can pull<br />
a rich set of additional data, breaking out the site’s traffic by source<br />
(e.g., organic versus paid versus direct traffic versus other referrers). You<br />
can also pull information on their highest-volume search terms for both paid<br />
and organic search.  11. Determine the number of indexed pages in each of the<br />
three major search engines, using site:theirdomain.com.  12. If relevant,<br />
obtain Technorati’s authority number for the site, which derives from<br />
the number of individual, unique blogs that have linked to a site in the<br />
past 90 days.  13. If relevant, get Google’s feed subscriber numbers for<br />
the site, which you can find by searching for domains inside Google Reader.<br />
14. If relevant, determine Bloglines’ subscription numbers for the site,<br />
which derives from searches performed inside Bloglines.  15. Search on<br />
the company brand name at Google, restricted to the past six months (by<br />
appending &amp;as_qdr=m6 as outlined earlier).  16. Repeat the preceding step,<br />
but for only the past three months (using &amp;as_qdr=m3).  17. Perform a Google<br />
Blog Search for the brand name using the default settings (no time frame).<br />
18. Repeat the preceding step, but limit it to blog posts from the past month<br />
(using&amp;as_qdr=m1).</p>
<p>(prime candidate for a Google spreadsheet app script)</p>
<p>When examining a competing website, ask yourself the following questions:<br />
• What content do they currently have on their site(s)? how they view their<br />
customers and how they use content to get links. For example, they may have a<br />
series of how-to articles related to their products, or a blog, or some nifty<br />
free tools that users may like. If they do have a blog, develop a sense as<br />
to what they write about. Also, see whether the content they are developing<br />
is noncommercial or simply a thinly disguised ad.  • How rapidly is that<br />
content changing? Publishers with rapidly changing websites are actively<br />
investing in their websites, whereas those who are not adding new articles<br />
or updating content may not be actively investing in their sites.</p>
<p>What type of content is it? Articles? Videos? Images? Music? News feeds? The<br />
type of content they focus on can give you insight into their marketing<br />
strategy.  • Are they collecting user-generated content? Sites that gather<br />
a meaningful amount of user-generated content tend to have an engaged user<br />
audience.  • Are they trying to generate sign-ups or conversions in a direct<br />
way with their content? Or is it editorial in tone and structure? This can<br />
give you more visibility into the way their strategy is put together.</p>
<p>You can extract a tremendous amount of information via link<br />
analysis. Yahoo! Site Explorer provides a start, but going past a simple list<br />
of links to gathering link data such as anchor text and link authority requires<br />
a more advanced tool, such as Link Diagnosis (http://www.linkdiagnosis.com),<br />
Linkscape (http://www.seomoz.org/linkscape), or Majestic-<span class="caps">SEO</span> (http://www<br />
.majesticseo.com).</p>
<p>Dig deeper What pages on the site are attracting the most links? These are<br />
probably the most important pages on the site, particularly if those pages<br />
also rank well for competitive search terms.</p>
<p>Determine where the content is getting its links This can help you develop<br />
your own content and link-building strategies.</p>
<p>Analyze anchor text Do they have an unusually large number of people linking<br />
to them using highly optimized anchor text?</p>
<p>Determine whether they are engaging in incentive-based link building Are<br />
they offering incentives in return for links, such as award programs or<br />
membership badges? Do those programs appear to be successful?</p>
