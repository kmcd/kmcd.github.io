<p>What&#8217;s the competition neglecting?  What do they do well?  What are<br />
the boundaries of the topics that they focus upon?  What don’t they<br />

level are they pitching their blog (beginners, intermediate, advanced)?<br />
What questions are their readers asking in comments?  What style or voice<br />
do they write in?  How do they monetize themselves?  What types of posts<br />
seem to get the most attention (comments, Trackbacks, incoming links)?<br />
What is their design like? What do they do well and what do they do poorly?<br />
What are other blogs writing about them? (Use Technorati to check this.)<br />
If they have an open or unlocked stats package what can you learn from their<br />
stats? What pages are popular? Where does their incoming traffic come from?</p>
<p>Will you have enough content? books, notes, re-purposing existing content,<br />

<p>= Writing</p>
<p>For a blog to be successful, your content needs to be useful and unique to<br />
your readers.</p>
<p>Information—Many successful blogs are built on the thirst that some have<br />
to be informed on an issue, product, or topic.</p>
<p>Community—People have a desire to belong. Many successful blogs tap into this<br />
and are all about connecting people interested in explor- ing a topic. Quite<br />
often the topic is secondary to the actual relation- ship built on the blog.</p>
<p>Who are your favorite blogs attracting? Why is that? Spend some time to think<br />
about who you want to attract to your blog and the kind of work, lifestyle,<br />
and needs they have.</p>
<p>Survey friends, follow the comments sections of other blogs on your topic to<br />
see what readers are asking there, and look in forums and online discussion<br />
groups that cover your topics, where there is usually a lot of question<br />
asking going on.</p>
<p>== Writing Tips</p>
<p>Scannable Content Lists Formatting—Use bold, <span class="caps">CAPITALS</span>, italics, underlining<br />
headings Pics borders/block quotes Whitespace Short paragraphs Dont bury<br />
your points</p>
<p>== Will written title (key)</p>
<p>Keep it simple Grab attention Meet a need—“how to&#8230;” or<br />
“tutorial”-type articles Be descriptive Use keywords Build a swipe file</p>
<p>&#8594; Check out copyblogger Break up loonger posts into mini-series Stick to<br />
one topic/point per post</p>
<p>Informational—This is one of the more common blog post types, where a<br />
blogger simply gives information on a topic. It could be a definition post<br />
or a longer explanation of some aspect of the niche that you’re writing<br />
on. This is the crux of successful sites like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Reviews—Another highly searched-for term on the Web is “review.” Every<br />
time I’m considering buying a new product I head to Google and search for a<br />
review on it first—I know that I’m not alone.  Reviews come in all shapes<br />
and sizes and on virtually every product or service you can think of. Give<br />
your fair and insightful opinion and ask readers for their opinion—reviews<br />
can be highly powerful posts that have a great longevity.</p>
<p>Lists—One of the easiest ways to write a post is to make a list.  Posts with<br />
content like, “The Top Ten ways to&#8230;,” “7 Reasons why&#8230;,” “5<br />
Favorite&#8230;,” or “53 mistakes that bloggers make when&#8230;” are not<br />
only easy to write, but are usually very popular with readers and can be<br />
successful at getting links from other bloggers.</p>
<p>Interviews—Sometimes when you’ve run out of insightful things to say it<br />
might be a good idea to let someone else do the talking in an interview. This<br />
is a great way to not only give your readers a relevant expert’s opinion, but<br />
to perhaps even learn something about the topic you’re writing yourself. One<br />
tip if you’re approaching people for an interview on your blog is don’t<br />
overwhelm them with questions. One or two good questions are more likely to<br />
get you a response than a long list of poorly thought-out ones.</p>
<p>Case studies—Another popular type of post is the case study, where you walk<br />
readers through an example of something that you’re writ- ing about. These<br />
are useful posts for readers because they are real-life situations and often<br />
have practical tips associated with them.</p>
<p>Profiles—Profile posts are similar to case studies but focus in on a<br />
particular person. Pick an interesting personality in your niche and do a<br />
little research on them to present to your readers. Point out how they’ve<br />
reached the position they are in and write about the</p>
<p>characteristics that they have that others in your niche might like to<br />
develop to be successful.</p>
<p>Link posts—The “link post” is a favorite form of blogging for many<br />
bloggers and is simply a matter of finding a quality post on another site<br />
or blog and linking up to it. You would usually also include an explanation<br />
of why you’re linking up, a comment of your own take on the topic, and/or<br />
a quote from the post. Adding your own com- ments makes these posts more<br />
original and useful to your readers.  The more original content the better,<br />
but don’t be afraid to bounce off others in this way. These link posts are<br />
powerful because they not only give your readers something good to read, but<br />
they can get you noticed and help you build relationships with other bloggers.</p>
<p>“Problem” posts—Another term that is often searched for in Google<br />
in conjunction with product names is the word “problem” or “prob-<br />
lems”—that is, where people are searching for help on a problem that they<br />
might have with something that they own or are trying to do.  Problem posts<br />
are similar to review posts but focus more upon the negatives of a product<br />
or service. Don’t write these pieces just for the sake of them, but if<br />
you find a genuine problem with something, a problem post can work for you.</p>
<p>Comparison posts—Life is full of decisions between two or more options. Write<br />
a post contrasting two products, services, or approaches that outlines the<br />
positives and negatives of each choice. In a sense these are review posts<br />
but are a little wider in focus. I find that these posts do very well on some<br />
of my product blogs where people actually search for “X Product comparison<br />
to Y Product” or “X vs. Y” in search engines.</p>
<p>Inspirational—On the flip side of the angry rant (and not all rants<br />
have to be angry) are inspirational and motivational posts. Tell a tory<br />
of success or paint a picture of “what could be.” People like to hear<br />
good-news stories in their niche because it motivates them to persist with<br />
what they are doing. Find examples of success in your own experience or that<br />
of others and spread the word.  Research—In the early days of ProBlogger,<br />
I wrote quite a few research-oriented posts where I’d carry out surveys<br />
or gather statistics on different aspects of blogging. Research posts can<br />
take a lot of time, but they can also be well worth it if you come up with<br />
interesting conclusions. Present your findings with a nice chart and with<br />
useful statistics, and you’ll often find other bloggers in your niche will<br />
link up to you.</p>
<p>Collation posts—These are a strange combination of research and link<br />
posts. In them you pick a topic that you think your readers will find helpful<br />
and then research what others have said about it. Once you’ve found their<br />
opinion, you bring together everyone’s ideas (often with short quotes)<br />
and tie them together with a few of your own comments to draw out the common<br />
themes that you see. These posts are often quite interesting to readers but<br />
can help you build relationships with others blogs who you quote and link<br />
up to.  Prediction and review posts—We see a lot of these at the end and<br />
start of the year when people do their “year in review” posts and look<br />
at the year ahead and predict what developments might happen in their niche<br />
in the coming months. Prediction posts will often cause interesting debate.</p>
<p>Critique posts—Numerous bloggers have made a name for them- selves by writing<br />
strong critiques of other people, products, or com- panies. Though sometimes<br />
these border on being “attack posts” and have rant-like qualities, a good<br />
constructive critique can be an effec- tive way of making an impression upon<br />
others. People like to hear opinions, and though they might not always agree<br />
with them, if they are insightful, constructive, and respectfully written<br />
posts, they can lead to you growing your reputation in a niche.</p>
<p>Hypothetical posts—“What if” or hypothetical posts can be quite<br />
fun. Pick something that could happen down the track in your industry and<br />
begin to unpack what the implications of it would be.  “What if Google and<br />
Yahoo! merged?” “What if Canon released an update to xyz camera?” These<br />
posts can actually position you well in search engines if the hypothetical<br />
situation actually happens.  Satirical posts—Well-written satire, parody,<br />
or humor can be incredi- bly powerful and is brilliant for generating links<br />
for your blog. Keep in mind that sometimes these types of posts will be<br />
misinterpreted and cause people to react strongly.</p>
<p>Memes and projects—A meme is an idea that spreads, an “idea virus” as<br />
Seth Godin would describe it. In blogging this can be seen as an article or<br />
topic that gets copied from one blog to another, usu- ally with a link back<br />
to the originator. Write a post that somehow involves your readers and gets<br />
them to replicate it in someway. Start a poll, an award, a competition,<br />
or ask your readers to submit a post/link or run a survey or quiz. These<br />
types of posts add an ele- ment of interactivity to your blog and sometimes<br />
can go viral through the blogosphere.</p>
<p>At ProBlogger my most effective series have included the following:</p>

<p>= Promotion</p>
<p>Half the battle of getting a blog off the ground is to have not just “good”<br />
content but compelling content. So, next time you stop to read an article,<br />
ask yourself why. What was it about this particular article that caught<br />
your eye? How had the author presented it? Analyze the headline, where you<br />
found it, and most importantly, how you can integrate these lessons into<br />
your own blogging.</p>
<p>comment on blogs focused on a niche topic similar to yours because the<br />
readers there will more likely be interested in your blog.</p>
<p>Link generously and in context to other blogs in your posts.</p>
<p>Pay a VA to comment?</p>
<p>A blog carnival is a post in a blog that summarizes a collection of articles<br />
from many different blogs on a specific topic. The idea is to collect the<br />
best content on a topic in a given week</p>
<p>Networking is critical, so join forums, email lists, and newsgroups within<br />
your niche. Don’t comment just for the sake of it; try to add value to<br />
conver- sations. When readers reach out to you with a comment, email or link<br />
from their blog and follow up and interact with them</p>
<p>== Link bait</p>
<p>Tools—Create a useful, fun, newsworthy, or cool tool.</p>
<p>Competitions—Organize a contest or drawing with a valuable prize.<br />
Lists—List the 10 best blogs in your niche, or the top products, and so<br />
on. Look to glossy magazines for inspiration; they are full of lists! See<br />
Figure 8-2 to see how lists continue to work, despite some backlash.<br />
Statistics—Do a survey and release the results. One of my clients used to<br />
do a global survey relatively inexpensively that got them massive attention.<br />
Interviews—Interview a celebrity or someone popular in your niche.<br />
Resources—Create the ultimate resource or reference for a topic.</p>
<p>Scan through Digg, Reddit, and other social bookmarking sites, and note the<br />
headlines and introductions.</p>
<p>Run competitions/promotions</p>
<p>Social media</p>
<p>Write attention-grabbing headlines.  Paragraphs should be short and punchy.<br />
Use bullets, images, and subheads to aid skimming.  Pull out interesting<br />
quotes and key points.  Make it something people will want to talk about,<br />
share, or come back to.</p>
<p>Increase Page Views on Your Blog</p>
<p>Highlight related posts. One of the more common practices of blog- gers<br />
to encourage readers to read multiple pages on their blogs is to highlight<br />
related posts at the end of your article.</p>
<p>Interlink within posts. A similar but perhaps more effective tech- nique is<br />
to highlight relevant posts within the content of your posts.  If you’re<br />
writing a post that mentions something similar to what you’ve written before,<br />
simply link to your previous post from within your article. For example,<br />
I’ve written about this technique previ- ously in a post on increasing<br />
the longevity of key posts.</p>
<p>Highlight key posts and categories in your sidebar. Highlighting your category<br />
pages is another useful technique to encourage your readers to find more<br />
posts on the same topic. To explicitly name what your category is can also be<br />
useful. That is, rather than just having the category name at the end of the<br />
post, try something like “read more posts like this in our <span class="caps">XYZ</span> category.”</p>
<p>Create compilation pages. Darren has a page at ProBlogger that lists his top<br />
20 posts, and we have a “best of” list at Performancing.com also. Many<br />
first-time readers use these pages to discover content to read. Every post<br />
a visitor reads increases the chances that they will become loyal readers.</p>
<p>Write a series. You need to be careful with writing series of posts over<br />
periods of time, but they are a great way to keep readers coming back,<br />
and once they are complete to have them surf through multiple pages on your<br />
blog. Don’t create series just for the sake of increasing page views, of<br />
course—this can really frustrate readers—but use them on longer posts<br />
or when you genuinely want to cover a larger topic over time.</p>
<p>Use excerpts. There is always debate over this topic. Should you show the full<br />
article on your homepage and feed or snippets? If you only have partial content<br />
visible, the reader has to click through to see the full thing. Though this<br />
is certainly a benefit of partial feeds, doing so will cause some readers<br />
to unsubscribe to your blog com- pletely. This is a cost/benefit scenario<br />
that individual bloggers need to weigh.</p>
<p>Be interactive. An effective way to get readers coming back to your blog many<br />
times over a day is to have a blog that people want to interact with. Liz<br />
Strauss has “open mike” events in her comment area at Successful-blog.com<br />
and this has made the blog less of a pub- lication and more of a party!</p>
<p>= Top blogs</p>
<p>Lifehacker.com—Productivity is a massive subject online, and Lifehacker<br />
is probably the best known. Rather than just write about productivity in<br />
general, Lifehacker approaches the subject with a techie slant, which the<br />
audience really enjoys.</p>

that are all around you is a great habit to get into. You can learn from<br />
the success of others in some surprising ways. It is not just about looking<br />
at fellow bloggers—read biographies or analyze your favorite celebrity or<br />
television show. Knowing how people got where they are helps you develop a<br />
success mindset.</p>
<p>Lessons from Niche Bloggers 1. Identify an underserved niche. It is very<br />
difficult to get a photogra- phy blog noticed in today’s blogosphere. David<br />
Hobby chose a micro- niche, a niche of a niche, and served it comprehensively<br />
with his Strobist blog. Make it easy on yourself, and choose a niche where<br />
you can make a difference.</p>
<p>2. Define your blog’s mission and articulate it in a benefits-led way. If<br />
a reader sees your blog’s mission and thinks “so what?” you have<br />
failed. Be sure your blog’s mission helps the reader.</p>
<p>3. Own your mission and stay focused. It would be so easy for any of these<br />
blogs to see their growing audience as permission to cover any- thing they<br />
like. Once in a while they can get away with it, kind of like a pop star<br />
deciding to release a swing album. Too much, though, and the valuable and<br />
unique quality that attracted readers could go away.</p>
<p><span class="caps">EXERCISE</span> Out of all the blogs you know of, which would you categorize<br />
as niche and which would have more general appeal? Do these blogs change<br />
approach depending on their category?</p>
<p>Community counts—Great content is important, but when it is com- bined<br />
with a vibrant community, that is when your blog will really take off.</p>
<p>Test and research—Blogging is a moving target. Working out what works<br />
and which tactics do not takes research, experimentation, test- ing, and<br />
discussion. Over the years, Darren experimented with new developments from<br />
MyBlogLog.com to Chitika.com. Make sure you keep up with the times</p>
<p>Lessons from Robert Scoble 1. Network—Be a hub and a connector. Robert<br />
seems to spend as much time having lunches with movers and shakers as he<br />
does blogging and speaking. Blogging is as much about relationships as it<br />
is writing.  To succeed, you need great content, of course, but it also<br />
helps to be well connected.</p>
<p>2. Links should be unique and interesting—Link to great stuff that others<br />
haven’t noticed. One of the great things about Robert’s link blog is that<br />
it doesn’t just replicate the popular Digg and del.icio.us stories—he<br />
has his own sources. If you are linking out to the same old stuff, people<br />
won’t need your feed cluttering up their reader.  Find fresh and exciting<br />
new stuff, though, and your readers will reward you.</p>
<p>Robert Scoble owes a large part of his success to his huge network of con-<br />
tacts. Make a plan for how you are going to grow your network starting today.</p>
<p>Lessons from Tim Ferriss 1. Craft your posts—Unlike many of the blogs<br />
listed here, Tim does not post several times a day. In fact, there can be<br />
several days between posts. He explained in a ProBlogger interview that this<br />
allows him to more carefully craft his articles and tweak his head- lines;<br />
it also allows time for comments to accumulate.  2. Say what you mean—Some<br />
of his posts are intentionally controver- sial. He says top stories almost<br />
always polarize people, so he tries to take a strong stand on one side or<br />
the other of an issue.  3. Cover topics that anyone can comment on—Tim<br />
suggests consider- ing subjects that he can imagine allowing his parents,<br />
siblings, or friends having advice to share.</p>
<p>Lessons from PopCrunch 1. Learn and implement—Do your research; find out what<br />
works; use what you learn from other niches in your own.  2. Mix media—Try<br />
video, try audio; see what your audience reacts to.  3. Promote—Yes, content<br />
is king, but who will notice without the traf- fic? Push the traffic any way<br />
you can. Only when you really reach the top can you stop promoting completely.</p>
<p>Be radical. Half-measures won’t do. People only remember the biggest,<br />
fastest, richest, easiest, hardest, most expensive, cheapest, and whatever<br />
superlative you can think of.</p>
<p>It’s not about you. This is about your reader; leave your ego out of it.<br />
One of the biggest mistakes bloggers make is being all me-me-me.  People<br />
should care. If people do not love it or hate it, then you need to push<br />
harder. “Like” is not remarkable; it should cause passion.</p>
<p>Educational—Some blog readers are primarily interested in learning something<br />
new about a given topic.</p>
<p>Informative—Many successful blogs are built on the thirst that some have<br />
to be informed on an issue, product, or topic.</p>
<p>Thoughtful—Some blog readers want a place where they can have their minds<br />
open to viewpoints, and have a good old-fashioned dia- logue, debate, or<br />
even a fight over an issue.</p>
<p>Tell Your Story Telling your stories can be very powerful. Put yourself<br />
into your posts; talk about how you learned what you are talking about. Give<br />
examples, be humor- ous, and express emotion. Readers want to connect with<br />
you, and telling a story rather than “just the facts” helps bring alive<br />
the topic.</p>
<p><span class="caps">EXERCISE</span> What stories do you have to tell? What are the lessons you<br />
learned? Next time you are relating a story that you think is interesting,<br />
make a note of it for use in your blog.</p>
<p>Entertain Be humorous, intriguing, irreverent, fun, push boundaries, surprise<br />
your read- ers, include a little spice. Use entertaining pictures, video,<br />
audio, and so on. Be playful.</p>
<p>Inform Produce “how to” or “tips” posts. You might also want to do<br />
“introduction to&#8230;”-type posts. Ask readers what they want to learn<br />
about and then answer their questions.</p>
<p>Build Community Write inspirational posts with heart. Pay a lot of attention<br />
to the readers you have, ask lots of questions, answer their questions;<br />
empower people to con- tribute as much as they can. Include everyone; do<br />
not fall into the trap of “in” jokes and shorthand. Warmth, welcoming,<br />
and discussion are the keys to a great community.</p>
