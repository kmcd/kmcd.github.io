Like js but without punctuation & passing function keyword littered all over the place.

Whitespace sensitive

loop construct: for i in []

has ruby like ranges

inline if then else

no explicit return needed

Javascript: $(function() {
Coffeescript: jQuery ->  

replace references to this with @, eg this.value becomes @value
