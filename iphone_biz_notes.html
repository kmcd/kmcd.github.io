<div class='content'>                                 
   <p>= Market research</p>
<p>Fulfilling a need</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pinpoint a need or issue that is currently not being addressed by existing apps.</li>
	<li>mobile experience significantly easier than performing the same tasks on a desktop computer?</li>
	<li>what feature(s) can you add that would solve the needs not currently addressed by your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>take a look at your own needs and interests.</p>
<p>What interests do you have outside of technology?</p>
<p>try turning to your friends and family. See what specific needs and interests they <br />
have that might be well suited for a mobile app</p>
<p>don’t discount the ease of flipping through the pages of the latest magazines</p>
<p>Bump enhances the mobile experience by greatly simplifying the exchange of contact information<br />
between two people.</p>
<p>“Our primary goal when designing Bump was to create a simple, fun, and intuitive way<br />
to connect two phones,” says David Lieb, cofounder and president of Bump<br />
Technologies, Inc. “The accelerometer and location services allow us to do that: Bump<br />
monitors the output of the accelerometers and sends the output of the accelerometers<br />
up to the global Bump servers whenever a physical bump is felt. The servers then match<br />
up any pair of phones that felt the same bump at the same time in the same location.<br />
This allows connections to be made between any two phones with just a simple bump of<br />
the hands.”</p>
<p>= Promotion</p>
<p>Staying on top of what your competitors are doing is one of your primary jobs as a<br />
developer.</p>
<p>Try to keep your app name to 12 characters or less</p>
<p>Encourage users to rate your app with a built-in custom prompt.</p>
include a Tell A Friend button in your app,

<p>= Freemium</p>
<ul>
	<li>Offer a free “lite” version of your app to help drive sales for the paid</li>
	<li>version, or utilize a “freemium” model with premium features available</li>
	<li>through In-App Purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lite Version vs. In-App Purchase</p>
<p>Securing Market Share: Give It Away Now, Up-Sell Later</p>
<p>= Testing and Usability</p>
<p>Have you let anyone else test-drive your app? If not, then it’s imperative that you do!<br />
Recruiting beta testers to evaluate your app is one of the most effective ways to unearth<br />
hard-to-find bugs and other critical issues</p>
<p>Including an in-app mechanism for customers to easily send you feedback directly can<br />
help alleviate many of those negative app store postings.</p>
<p>For most mobile apps, if a manual is required to explain how to use even the most basic<br />
functions, then you should seriously consider rethinking your current interface design.</p>
<p>Planting Knowledge Seeds with On-Screen Tips</p>
<p>Interactive demo</p>
<p>Convertbot includes a very effective demo, placing the main interface on autopilot, showing you how<br />
to use the unique UI elements with pop-up balloon descriptions.<br />
The only drawback to this approach is that it requires you to spend the time and energy<br />
to construct an effective in-app demo.</p>
<p>Even more important than your own testing in the iPhone Simulator and on an actual<br />
device is having multiple people test your app. After performing extensive tests of your<br />
own, it’s highly recommended that you round up a group of volunteers who are willing to<br />
beta-test your application before release in the App Store.</p>
<p>Analytics</p>
<p>= Prerelease Buzz</p>
<p>Marketing Requires an Audience, So Invest the Time to Find Yours</p>
<p>If you don’t yet have a Twitter account, a Facebook fan page, or a good rapport with<br />
high-profile bloggers and journalists, then it’s never too soon to get the ball rolling. How<br />
early should you start? It usually takes a few months to acquire a decent number of<br />
followers on Twitter and Facebook, so you should dive into the social media sea at least<br />
three months before you plan on submitting your app to the App Store.</p>
<p>No one likes an over-zealous, aggressive salesperson<br />
who clutters their Twitter streams and email inboxes with too much marketing noise. It’s<br />
all about gently stoking the fire, building anticipation and interest. Simply whet their<br />
appetite, leaving them wanting for more&#8230;be a tease!</p>
<p>elevator pitch,</p>
<p>No matter what kind of products you develop, you should always have a high-resolution<br />
version of your logo available, just in case the press request it.</p>
<p>Like your company logo, you should also have a high-resolution icon and logo for your<br />
iPhone app.</p>
<p>Having a few good screenshots of your app in action</p>
<p>ScreenCast (optional)</p>
<p>if you do plan on creating a video trailer for your app, then I definitely<br />
recommend completing it before your app is released so that it can help boost<br />
awareness from the very beginning</p>
<p>Record the emulator instead of videoing the app live</p>
<p>Dedicated web site (domain + posterous)</p>
<p><acronym title=" title, desctiption &amp; keywords meta tags, keyword rich text, clean keyword URLS, sitemap?"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym></p>
<p>Mockup site (app?) in Balsamiq OR paper</p>
<p>Could be an image intensive activity &#8594; outsource/offload</p>
<p>Follow on FB, Twitter, Share links</p>
<p>free email newsletter can really benefit your prerelease<br />
marketing efforts. Interested site visitors can subscribe, and then a month later after<br />
they’ve forgotten about your app, you can send them an email announcing its availability</p>
<p>Gaining Followers on Twitter</p>
<p>Who you follow matters<br />
Follow your fans<br />
Quality content is king!</p>
<p>Retweet! If someone posts something that you feel your audience<br />
would enjoy, then retweet it. Twitter is built on the spirit of karma.<br />
What goes around comes around. Spend the time promoting other<br />
people’s tweets more than you promote yourself, and you’ll cultivate a<br />
deeper bond with your followers. They may even retweet your posts<br />
more often to return the favor.</p>
<p>Auto-update FB, Twitter &amp; more with Posterous (beware low <span class="caps">SEO</span> from duplicate<br />
content).</p>
<p>Collecting Prerelease Press and Testimonials</p>
<ul>
	<li>Contact tech journalists / sites</li>
	<li>Post-release Buzz</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be prepared to set aside the first two weeks to focus on nothing<br />
but promoting your new iPhone app.</p>
<p>Request reviews, publicize your app on Twitter and<br />
Facebook, set up media interviews, post blog articles, submit your app for awards, and<br />
the list goes on&#8230;. Once your marketing efforts start to pay off with an increase in sales<br />
and/or a rise in the App Store charts, then you can gradually ease back into your normal<br />
work life with only a couple hours a day spent on app marketing.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to dedicate the necessary hours to post-release marketing, then it’s in<br />
your best interest to hire a third-party company to handle this job.</p>
<p>Google Alerts( track your app &amp; competitors )</p>
<p>Press Release pg 350</p>
<p>Issuing Promo Codes: Soliciting App Reviews on Influential Blogs and Review Sites</p>
<ul>
	<li>elevator pitch</li>
	<li>Three to five screenshots</li>
	<li>screen cast</li>
	<li>App web site <span class="caps">URL</span></li>
	<li>App icon &amp; download link</li>
	<li>Promo code</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>“After receiving a new press release or app review inquiry, how long</li>
	<li>does it typically take for an article or review to be written and posted</li>
	<li>online?”</li>
	<li>“If I don’t receive a response, may I check back with you in a week or</li>
	<li>two?”</li>
</ul>
