<div class='content'>                                 
   <p>From <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a> by Farley &amp; Humble. You can check out the book and articles on their web site.</p>
<h2>Release anti-patterns</h2>
<p>Antipattern: Deploying Software Manually</p>
<ul>
	<li>The production of extensive, detailed documentation that describes the steps to be taken and the ways in which the steps may go wrong</li>
	<li>Reliance on manual testing to confirm that the application is running correctly</li>
	<li>Frequent calls to the development team to explain why a deployment is going wrong on a release day</li>
	<li>Frequent corrections to the release process during the course of a release</li>
	<li>Environments in a cluster that differ in their configuration</li>
	<li>Releases that take more than a few minutes to perform</li>
	<li>Releases that are unpredictable in their outcome, that often have to be rolled back or run into unforeseen problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Antipattern: Deploying to a Production-like Environment Only after Development Is Complete</p>
<p>Antipattern: Manual Configuration Management of Production Environments</p>
<p>Feedback is essential to frequent, automated releases. There are three criteria<br />
for feedback to be useful.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any change, of whatever kind, needs to trigger the feedback process.</li>
	<li>The feedback must be delivered as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>The delivery team must receive feedback and then act on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical tests</p>
<ul>
	<li>The software’s unit tests must pass.</li>
	<li>test coverage and other technology-specific metrics.</li>
	<li>business acceptance criteria—that it delivers the business value that was intended.</li>
	<li>capacity, availability, security,</li>
	<li>exploratory testing and a demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>Principles</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a Repeatable, Reliable Process for Releasing Software</li>
	<li>Automate Almost Everything</li>
	<li>Keep Everything in Version Control</li>
	<li>If It Hurts, Do It More Frequently, and Bring the Pain Forward</li>
	<li>Build Quality In (catch defects as early in the delivery process as possible)</li>
	<li>Done Means Released</li>
</ol>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Keep the Build and Test Process Short</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll add more to these reading notes as I find useful information in the book.</p>
