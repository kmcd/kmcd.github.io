   <p>= Market testing</p>
<p>Step One: Pick an Affordably Reachable<br />
Niche Market</p>
<p>Be a member of your target market and don&#8217;t speculate what others need or will be willing <br />
to buy.</p>
<p>1. Which social, industry, and professional groups do you<br />
belong to, have you belonged to, or do you understand,<br />
whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational<br />
cyclists, car restoration aficionados, dancers, or other?<br />
Look creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits,<br />
and hobbies and compile a list of all the groups, past and present,<br />
that you can associate yourself with. Look at products and books you own, include online and offline subscriptions, and ask your-<br />
self, &#8220;What groups of people purchase the same?&#8221; Which maga-<br />
zines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?</p>
<p>2. Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not important that<br />
these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)—only that<br />
they spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on<br />
products of some type. Call these magazines, speak to the ad-<br />
vertising directors, and tell them that you are considering adver-<br />
tising; ask them to e-mail their current advertising rate card and<br />
include both readership numbers and magazine back-issue<br />
samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell<br />
direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers or websites—the more repeat<br />
advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a<br />
magazine is for them&#8230; and will be for us.</p>
<p>Step Two: Brainstorm (Do Not Invest In) Products</p>
<p>Pick the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their<br />
own magazines with full-page advertising that costs less than<br />
$5,000. There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers.<br />
This is the fun part. Now we get to brainstorm or find</p>
<p>The Main Benefit Should Be Encapsulated in One Sentence.</p>
<p>It Should Cost the Customer $50-200.</p>
<p>aim for an 8-iox markup, which means a $100<br />
product can&#8217;t cost me more than $12.50.</p>
<p>It Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture. This is<br />
critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales<br />
demand without stockpiling product in advance. I will not pursue any<br />
product that takes more than three to four weeks to manufacture, and<br />
I recommend aiming for one to two weeks from order placement to<br />
shippable product.</p>
<p>How do you know how long something takes to manufacture?<br />
Contact contract manufacturers who specialize in the type of<br />
products you&#8217;re considering: http://www.thomasnet.com/. Call a<br />
related manufacturer (e.g., toilet bowls) if you need a referral to a<br />
related manufacturer you cannot find (e.g., toilet cleaning solutions).<br />
Still no luck? Google different synonyms for your product in com-<br />
bination with &#8220;organization&#8221; and &#8220;association&#8221; to contact the appro-<br />
priate industry organizations. Ask them for referrals to contract<br />
manufacturers and for the names of their trade magazines, which</p>
<p>It Should Be Fully Explainable in a Good Online <span class="caps">FAQ</span>.</p>
<p>Option One: Resell a Product</p>
<p>Purchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the<br />
easiest route but also the least profitable. It is the fastest to set up<br />
but the fastest to die off due to price competition with other resellers.<br />
The profitable life span of each product is short unless an exclusivity<br />
agreement prevents others from selling it. Reselling is, however, an<br />
excellent option for secondary back-end27 products that<br />
27. &#8220;Back-end&#8221; products are products sold to customers once the sale of a primary<br />
product has been made. iPod covers and car <span class="caps">GPS</span> systems are two examples. These<br />
products can have lower margins, because there is no advertising cost to acquire the<br />
customer.</p>
<p>can be sold to existing customers or cross-sold28 to new customers<br />
online or on the phone.<br />
To purchase at wholesale, use these steps.<br />
i. Contact the manufacturer and request a &#8220;wholesale pricelist&#8221;<br />
(generally 40% off retail) and terms. 2. If a business tax ID<br />
number is needed, print out the proper<br />
forms from your state&#8217;s Secretary of State website and file<br />
for an <span class="caps">LLC</span> (which I prefer) or similar protective business<br />
structure for $100-200.</p>
<p>Option Two: License a Product</p>
<p>==&gt; Anti-glare roll down ?</p>
<p>Licensing is, however, dealmaking-intensive on both sides and a<br />
science unto itself. Creative contract negotiation is essential and most<br />
readers will run into problems if it&#8217;s their first product. For real-world<br />
case studies on both sides, ranging from Teddy Ruxpin to Tae-Bo,<br />
and full agreements with actual dollar amounts, visit<br />
www.fourhourworkweek.com.</p>
<p>Option Three: Create a Product</p>
<p>private labeling.&quot; Have you ever seen a chiropractor&#8217;s office with its own<br />
line of vitamin products or the Kirkland brand at Costco? Private<br />
labeling in action.</p>
<p>Goes big on info products (I see these as a by-product of work).</p>
<p>Confirming Sufficient Market Size<br />
•-Writer&#8217;s Market (www.writersmarket.com)<br />
Here you&#8217;ll find a listing of thousands of specialty and niche magazines, in-<br />
cluding circulation and subscription numbers. I prefer the print version.<br />
•-Standard Rate and Data Services (www.srds.com)<br />
Check out this resource for annual listings of magazine and company cus-<br />

for every conceivable product, from underwear and food products to<br />
airplane parts.<br />
•-Dropship Source (www.dropshipsource.com) (877-637-6774) This site<br />
offers an extensive how-to guide for finding manufacturers willing to drop-<br />
ship product to your customers, which allows you to avoid prepurchasing<br />
inventory. If this fails, just order the product you&#8217;d like to resell from a<br />
competitor and Google the &#8220;from&#8221; shipping address. This will often lead<br />
back to the drop-shipper, who can then be contacted directly.<br />

<p>Finding Public Domain Information to Repurpose</p>
<p>Be sure to speak with an intellectual property attorney before using apparent<br />
public domain material. If someone modifies 20% of a public domain work<br />
(through abridging and footnotes, for example), their &#8220;new&#8221; complete work<br />
can be copyrighted.</p>
<p>==&gt; Find out what publicly available texts people are studying and provide <br />
complementary notes &amp; interacitve environment.</p>

Project Gutenberg is a digital library of more than 15,000 pieces of litera-<br />
ture considered to be in the public domain.<br />

<p>Licensing Ideas to Others for Royalties<br />
•~InventRight (www.inventright.com) (800-701-7993) Stephen Key is the<br />
most consistently successful inventor I&#8217;ve ever met, with millions in<br />
royalties from companies like Disney, Nestle, and Coca-Cola. He is not<br />
high-tech but specializes in creating simple products or improving on<br />
existing products and then licensing (renting) his ideas to large<br />
corporations. He comes up with the idea, files a provisional patent for less<br />
than $200, and then lets another company do the work while he collects<br />
checks. This site introduces his fail-proof process for doing the same. His<br />
techniques for cold calling alone are invaluable. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>•-Guthy-Renker Corporation (www.guthyrenker.com)<br />
(760-773-9022) <span class="caps">GRC</span> is the 800-pound infomercial gorilla. It brings in<br />
more than $1.3 billion per year in sales with mega-hits like Tony Robbins,<br />
Proactiv Solution, and Winsor Pilates. Don&#8217;t expect more than a 2-4%<br />
royalty if you make the cut, but the numbers are huge enough to make it<br />
worth a look. Submit your product online.</p>
<p>Trolling Patents for Unexploited Ideas to Turn into Products<br />
&#8220;^United States Patent and Trademark Office (www.uspto.gov) (800-<br />
786-9199)</p>

under &#8220;Technology Transfer Offices.&#8221;<br />
•-www.uiausa.org/Resources/InventorGroups.htm<br />
For inventors&#8217; groups and associations, call and ask if members have any-<br />
thing to license.</p>
<p>Income Autopilot II -<span class="caps">TESTING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MUSE</span></p>
<p>ewer than 5% of the 195,000 books published each year sell more<br />
than 5,000 copies. Teams of publishers and editors with decades of<br />
combined experience fail more times than not. The founder of Border&#8217;s<br />
Books lost $375 million of investor funding with Web Van,38 a nationwide<br />
grocery delivery service. The problem? No one wanted it.<br />
The moral is that intuition and experience are poor predictors of which<br />
products and businesses will be profitable. Focus groups are equally<br />
misleading.</p>
<p>To get an accurate indicator of commercial viability, don&#8217;t ask<br />
people if they would buy—ask them to buy. The response to the<br />
second is the only one that matters.</p>
<p>Step Three: Micro-Test Your Products<br />
Micro-testing involves using inexpensive advertisements to test<br />
consumer response to a product prior to manufacturing.39</p>
<p>Best: Look at the competition and create a more-compelling<br />
offer on a basic one-to-three-page website (one to three<br />
hours). Test: Test the offer using short Google Adwords<br />
advertising<br />
campaigns (three hours to set up and five days of passive<br />
observation). Divest or Invest: Cut losses with losers and<br />
manufacture the<br />
winner(s) for sales rollout.</p>
<p>Technical feasability &amp; cost</p>
<p>Besting the Competition<br />
- Google competion, find buyers keywords</p>
<p>create a one-page (300-<br />
600 words) testimonial-rich advertisement that emphasizes their<br />
differentiators and product benefits using text and either personal<br />
photos or stock photos from stock photo websites. Both have<br />
spent two weeks collecting advertisements that have prompted<br />
them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in<br />
print or online—these will serve as models.</p>
<p>Sherwood first tests his concept with a 48-hour<br />
eBay auction that includes his advertising text. He sets the &#8220;reserve&#8221;<br />
(the lowest price he&#8217;ll accept) for one shirt at $50 and cancels the<br />
auction last minute to avoid legal issues since he doesn&#8217;t have<br />
product to ship. He has received bids up to $75 and decides to</p>
<p>41. How did I come up with the most successful BodyQUICK headline (&#8220;The Fastest<br />
Way to Increase Power and Speed Guaranteed&#8221;)? I borrowed it from the longest-<br />
running, and thus most profitable, Rosetta Stone headline: &#8220;The Fastest Way to Learn<br />
a Language GuaranteedTM&#8221; Reinventing the wheel is expensive—become an astute<br />
observer of what is already working and adapt it</p>
<p>1. Losing sight of dreams and falling into work for work&#8217;s sake (W4W) Please reread the <br />
introduction and next chapter of this book whenever you feel yourself falling into this trap.</p>
<p>2. Micromanaging and e-mailing to fill time Set the responsibilities, problem scenarios <br />
and rules, and limits of autonomous decisionmaking—then stop, for the sanity of everyone <br />
involved.</p>
<p>3. Handling problems your outsourcers or co-workers can handle</p>
<p>4. Helping outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more than once, or with<br />
noncrisis problems Give them if-then rules for solving all but the largest problems. <br />
Give them the freedom to act without your input, set the limits in writing, and then <br />
emphasize in writing<br />
that you will not respond to help with problems that are covered by these<br />
rules. In my particular case, all outsourcers have at their discretion the<br />
ability to fix any problem that will cost less than $400. At the end of each<br />
month or quarter, depending on the outsourcer, I review how their decisions<br />
have affected profit and adjust the rules accordingly, often adding new rules<br />
based on their good decisions and creative solutions.  5. Chasing customers,<br />
particularly unqualified or international prospects, when you have sufficient<br />
cash flow to finance your nonfinancial pursuits</p>
<p>6. Answering e-mail that will not result in a sale or that can be answered<br />
by a <span class="caps">FAQ</span> or auto-responder For a good example of an auto-responder that<br />
directs people to the appropriate information and outsourcers, e-mail<br />
info@brainquicken.com.</p>
<p>7. Working where you live, sleep, or should relax Separate your environments—designate a <br />
single space for work and solely work—or you will never be able to escape it.</p>
<p>8. Not performing a thorough 80/20 analysis every two to four weeks for your business and <br />
personal life</p>
<p>9. Striving for endless perfection rather than great or simply good enough,<br />
whether in your personal or professional life Recognize that this is often<br />
just another W4W excuse. Most endeavors are like learning to speak a foreign<br />
language: to be correct 95% of the time requires six months of concentrated<br />
effort, whereas to be correct 98% of the time requires 20-30 years.</p>
<p>10. Blowing minutiae and small problems out of proportion as an excuse to work</p>
<p>11. Making non-time-sensitive issues urgent in order to justify work How many<br />
times do I have to say it? Focus on life outside of your bank accounts, as<br />
scary as that void can be in the initial stages. If you cannot find meaning<br />
in your life, it is your responsibility as a human being to create it,<br />
whether that is fulfilling dreams or finding work that gives you purpose and<br />
selfworth—ideally a combination of both.</p>
<p>12. Viewing one product, job,<br />
or project as the end-all and be-all of your existence Life is too short to<br />
waste, but it is also too long to be a pessimist or nihilist. Whatever you&#8217;re<br />
doing now is just a stepping-stone to the next project or adventure. Any<br />
rut you get into is one you can get yourself out of. Doubts are no more<br />
than a signal for action of some type. When in doubt or overwhelmed, take<br />
a break and 80/20 both business and personal activities and relationships.</p>
<p>13. Ignoring the social rewards of life <br />
Surround yourself with smiling, positive people who have absolutely nothing to do with <br />
work. Create your muses alone if you must, but do not live your life alone. Happiness shared<br />
in the form of friendships and love is happiness multiplied.</p>
