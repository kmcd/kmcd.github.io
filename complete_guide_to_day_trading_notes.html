<div class='content'>                                 
   <p>= Questions</p>
<p>What are <span class="caps">MACD</span>, Stochastics ?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Moving average correllation/deviation</li>
	<li>Non-deterministic (ie not governed by inputs)</li>
</ul>
<p>How many weeks of the year are tradeable, eg christmas, holidays etc.</p>
<ul>
	<li>say 48</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not set a 0% stop loss on every trade?</p>
<ul>
	<li>because the market could slightly downtrend</li>
	<li>Can you build an incremental system, ie earn 100 then stop, earn 200 then stop.</li>
	<li>yes</li>
	<li>How long to achive statistical significance for back,paper testing ?</li>
	<li>How can you identify the trending markets?</li>
	<li>with a number of input signals (<span class="caps">MACD</span>, <span class="caps">RSI</span>, Bollinger bands)</li>
</ul>
<p>= Action points</p>
<p>Get a trading journal (or keep a blog)<br />
- why do you want to trade?</p>
<p>Confirm that the $25k <span class="caps">NYSE</span> pattern rule does not apply to:<br />
- ftse<br />
- non-margin (cash) a/c&#8217;s</p>
<p>= Notes</p>
<p>Don’t set daily targets when you trade. In order to make<br />
money, two conditions have to be met:<br />
1.) <span class="caps">YOU</span> have to be ready to trade.<br />
2.) <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span> must be ready to be traded.</p>
<p>There will be days when <span class="caps">YOU</span> are not at your best (sickness, emotional<br />
stress, no time because of an emergency, etc.), and there will be days<br />
when the market is not ready to be traded (e.g. holidays, including the<br />
days before and after holidays, days before a major news release, like the<br />
Federal announcement regarding interest rates or the unemployment re -<br />
port, etc.).</p>
<p>It’s important to start small and set a weekly goal for only <span class="caps">ONE</span> contract,<br />
or 100 shares. This goal should be <span class="caps">LOW</span>, very low, so that it is easy for<br />
you to reach it.<br />
Then keep raising the bar<br />
&gt; like it: incremental learning</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t avoid losses</p>
<p><span class="caps">STOP</span> <span class="caps">TRADING</span> when you&#8217;ve reached your target!</p>
<p>If you have a stop loss 50% of your profit target, you only need to succeed in <br />
50% of trades.<br />
&gt; Does this mean if you have a stop loss of 25% you only need to win 1 trade out<br />
of 4?</p>
<p>Daily targets create psycological pressure<br />
&gt; is this relevant to a <span class="caps">FATS</span>?</p>
<p>full-service brokers offer advice &amp; reports, discount brokers just fulfill orders</p>
<p>Developing a Trading strategy</p>
<ul>
	<li>Selecting a Market</li>
	<li>Selecting a Timeframe</li>
	<li>Selecting a Trading Style</li>
	<li>Defining Entry Points</li>
	<li>Defining Exit Points</li>
	<li>Evaluating Your Trading Strategy</li>
	<li>Improving Your Trading Strategy</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>start with small capital and then move up to larger capital when<br />
you’re comfortable enough with the market.</p>
<p>When trading a market, we want to ensure that we receive<br />
quick and accurate fills for our orders, and also that a large<br />
order placed by a market-maker or broker does not move the<br />
market in an erratic way.</p>
<p>It’s easier to trade a market that’s either going up or going down.</p>
<p>Currently there are more than 10,000 stocks available on U.S. stock exchanges.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Around 900 stocks have an average</li>
	<li>daily volume of more than 2,000,000 shares traded,</li>
	<li>and more than 600 of them are traded with over 3,000,000 shares</li>
	<li>per day.</li>
	<li>If you focus on these stocks then you won’t have a</li>
	<li>problem with market manipulation or slippage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stock markets are volatile:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">DJI</span> avg movement of 1-2%</li>
	<li>stock prices can vary from 2-8% on the day</li>
	<li>Futures are standardized contracts among buyers<br />
and sellers of commodities that specify the amount of a commodity, the<br />
grade/quality, and the delivery location.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stock option: the right &#8211; but not the obligation -– to<br />
buy (call) or sell (put) a specific underlying asset at a prearranged price<br />
on or before a given date.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Low volume (liquidity)</li>
	<li>option prices are <span class="caps">NOT</span> subject to market manipula -</li>
	<li>tion since the value of an option is not determined by supply and</li>
	<li>demand, but by a mathematical formula created by Black and</li>
	<li>Scholes.</li>
	<li>significant spread between the bid and the ask<br />
Very high volatility</li>
</ul>
<p>Day trading stock options is extremely risky and difficult, and not for the novice trader.<br />
&#8594; <span class="caps">AVOID</span>:</p>
<p>However, when selecting a very small timeframe like 1-minute, 3-<br />
minute, or 5-minute, you might experience a lot of “noise” that is cause<br />
by hedge funds, by scalpers, and by automated trading.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recommends 15 min charts to avoid algo &amp; scalping noise<br />
&gt; Does this contradict his video advise to use movement charts</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting a trading approach</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis aims to study the <span class="caps">CAUSE</span> of market movement</p>
<p>technical analysis: use of charts, trendlines, support and<br />
resistance levels, mathematical analysis tools, to predict future movements in a <br />
stock&#8217;s price, and to help identify trading opportunities</p>
<p>Charts</p>
<p>opening price (O), <br />
closing price &#169;, <br />
absolute high price of the day (H)<br />
absolute low price of the day (L)</p>
<p>Strategy: <br />
- identify an uptrend (from input signals)<br />
- buy with stop loss + profit target/cap</p>
<p>When should I enter?<br />
- when there&#8217;s an uptrend<br />
- at/near the top bollinger band (std dev from MA)<br />
- macd + 30<br />
- <span class="caps">RSI</span> + 70</p>
<p>When should I exit?<br />
- when you&#8217;ve achived your profit target</p>
<p>support level is the low point in any chart pattern (hourly, weekly, or annually)<br />
resistance level is the high or the peak point of the pattern.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Trend indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving averages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>average price at a point of time over a defined period</li>
	<li>reflect the latest average, while adhering to the same time measure.</li>
	<li>they lag the market, so they do not necessarily signal a change in trends.</li>
	<li>to avoid too long a lag, use shorter period, such as a 5- or 10-day moving average</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">MACD</span> (Gerald Apple) shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices</p>
<ul>
	<li>eg difference between a 26-bar exponential moving average (<span class="caps">EMA</span>) and the 12-bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Williams %R (Larry Williams)</p>
<ul>
	<li>compares a stock&#8217;s close to the high-low range over a certain period of time.</li>
	<li>0-100</li>
	<li>if prices are trading at the high of the high-low range (indicator reading close to 100),</li>
	<li>then the market is overbought,</li>
	<li><span class="caps">RSI</span> (Welles Wilder)</li>
	<li>overbought/oversold indicator</li>
	<li>compares the magnitude of a stock&#8217;s recent gains to the magnitude of its recent losses and</li>
	<li>turns that information into a number which ranges from 0 to 100.</li>
	<li>single parameter – the number of time periods – to use in the calcula -</li>
	<li>tion. In his book, Wilder recommends using 14 periods.</li>
	<li>One of the most important skills of a trader is being able to identify the <br />
direction of the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bollinger Bands:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 std dev <span class="caps">ABOVE</span> moving average &amp; 1 std dev <span class="caps">BELOW</span> moving average</li>
</ul>
<p>Make <span class="caps">SURE</span> to cancel your orders, or use so-called “bracket orders,” or<br />
“one-cancel-other (<span class="caps">OCO</span>) orders” for your profit target and stop loss.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If your stop loss is too low, the market can dip below your SL on an uptrend</li>
</ul>
<p>the key to trading success: small profits, consistently.</p>
<p>Back testing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>testing your strategy with historical data</li>
	<li>How long you backtest depends on the number of trades per day; more trades/day,<br />
the shorter the testing period</li>
</ul>
<p>While testing your trading strategy, you should keep detailed records of<br />
the wins and losses in order to produce a performance report.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Total trades</li>
	<li>Total profit</li>
	<li>Avg. profit per trade</li>
	<li>Winning %</li>
	<li>Avg. winning trade</li>
	<li>Avg. losing trade</li>
	<li>Profit factor (Gross Profit / Gross Loss)</li>
	<li>how many £ you&#8217;ll win for every one you lose</li>
	<li>Max drawdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimisation</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t over optimise: find a simple system &amp; stick with it.</p>
<p>1. Identify all the parameters in your system</p>
<p>For each parameter variation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2. Back test</li>
	<li>3. Paper trade</li>
	<li>4. Trade at low volume</li>
	<li>5. Trade at normal volume</li>
</ul>
<p>Might need taguchi or stats to simplify optimisation</p>
<p>Once your system is optimised: <span class="caps">STOP</span></p>
<p>Principles of successfull trading strategies</p>
<ul>
	<li>use few rules</li>
	<li>make it easy to understand</li>
	<li>The higher your trading frequency, the smaller your chances of having a losing month.</li>
	<li>start small and grow big.</li>
	<li>Automate Your Exits</li>
	<li>chose a valid back testing period</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
