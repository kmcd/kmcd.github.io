<p>The decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit.</p>
<p>All calories are not the same</p>
<p>low-Carb Diet</p>
<p><span class="caps">RULE</span> #1: <span class="caps">AVOID</span> “WHITE” <span class="caps">CARBOHYDRATES</span><br />
all bread, rice (including brown), cereal,<br />
potatoes, pasta, tortillas, and fried food with breading</p>
<p><span class="caps">RULE</span> #2: <span class="caps">EAT</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SAME</span> <span class="caps">FEW</span> <span class="caps">MEALS</span> <span class="caps">OVER</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">OVER</span> <span class="caps">AGAIN</span>.</p>

<p>make sure to have your rst meal within an hour of waking<br />
Meals are approximately four hours apart.</p>
<p>(07:30, 11:00, 13:00, 16:00, 20:00)</p>
<p>this diet is, first and foremost, intended to be effective, not fun</p>
<p><span class="caps">RULE</span> #3: DON’T <span class="caps">DRINK</span> <span class="caps">CALORIES</span>.</p>
<p>Drink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened tea, co ee<br />
Do not drink milk (including soy milk), normal soft drinks, or fruit juice.<br />
Red wine is OK</p>
<p><span class="caps">RULE</span> #4: DON’T <span class="caps">EAT</span> <span class="caps">FRUIT</span>.<br />
exceptions to the no-fruit rule are tomatoes and avocadoes</p>
<p><span class="caps">RULE</span> #5: <span class="caps">TAKE</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">DAY</span> <span class="caps">OFF</span> <span class="caps">PER</span> <span class="caps">WEEK</span>.</p>
<p>As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can<br />
successfully select his own methods.<br />
—Ralph Waldo Emerson<br />
The system—AT&amp;T solution.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SHOULD</span> I <span class="caps">TAKE</span> <span class="caps">ANY</span> <span class="caps">SUPPLEMENTS</span>?<br />
I suggest potassium, magnesium, and calcium. This diet will cause you to lose excess water, and<br />
electrolytes can go along with it.</p>
<p>Vitamin supplements</p>
<p>No dairy &#8211; yoghurt OK?</p>
<p><span class="caps">WHAT</span> <span class="caps">SHOULD</span> I <span class="caps">EAT</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">SNACKS</span>?<br />
There should be no need, or real physical urge, to eat snacks. If you are hungry, you’re not<br />
eating enough protein and legumes at each meal. This is an uber-common novice screwup. I’ve<br />
been there too. Eat more.</p>
<p>If you’re eating enough and still feel the urge to snack, it’s a psychological addiction, one that<br />
most often goes hand in hand with procrastination.</p>
<p>My most frequent breakfast consists of eggs, lentils, and spinach.<br />
eggs &amp; tomotoe</p>
<p>Stir fry is OK</p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #1: <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">EATING</span> <span class="caps">WITHIN</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">HOUR</span> OF <span class="caps">WAKING</span>, <span class="caps">PREFERABLY</span> <span class="caps">WITHIN</span> 30 <span class="caps">MINUTES</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #2: <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">EATING</span> <span class="caps">ENOUGH</span> <span class="caps">PROTEIN</span><br />
Get at least 20 grams of protein per meal.</p>
<p>This is absolutely most critical at breakfast. Eating at least 40% of your breakfast calories as<br />
protein will decrease carb impulses and promote a negative fat balance.</p>
<p>irst choice: down two to three whole eggs at<br />
breakfast. Second choice: if that’s impossible to stomach, add other protein-rich whole foods,<br />
such as turkey bacon, organic bacon, organic sausages, or cottage cheese. Third choice: have a<br />
30-gram protein shake with ice and water,</p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #3: <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">DRINKING</span> <span class="caps">ENOUGH</span> <span class="caps">WATER</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #6: <span class="caps">OVEREATING</span> “DOMINO FOODS”: <span class="caps">NUTS</span>, <span class="caps">CHICKPEAS</span> (<span class="caps">GARBANZO</span> <span class="caps">BEANS</span>), <span class="caps">HUMMUS</span>, <span class="caps">PEANUTS</span>,</p>
<p>“domino foods,” as eating one portion often creates a domino e ect of<br />
oversnacking.</p>
<p>Don’t eat anything that requires portion control.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #7: <span class="caps">OVERCONSUMING</span> <span class="caps">ARTIFICIAL</span> (OR “ALL-NATURAL”) <span class="caps">SWEETENERS</span>, <span class="caps">INCLUDING</span> <span class="caps">AGAVE</span> <span class="caps">NECTAR</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">MISTAKE</span> #7: <span class="caps">HITTING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GYM</span> <span class="caps">TOO</span> <span class="caps">OFTEN</span></p>
<p>Doing too much will not only not help, it will reverse your progress, as it also leads to<br />
overeating, sports drinks, and other assorted self- sabotage.<br />
Remember the <span class="caps">MED</span>. Less is more.</p>
<p>at least 500 milliliters of ice water on an empty stomach immediately<br />
upon waking</p>
<p>Take 5–10-minute cold showers before breakfast</p>
<p><span class="caps">INCREASING</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span> <span class="caps">CONTENT</span> IN <span class="caps">MEALS</span> <span class="caps">BLUNTS</span> <span class="caps">JUMPS</span> IN <span class="caps">GLUCOSE</span> <span class="caps">MUCH</span> <span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">THAN</span> <span class="caps">LEAN</span> <span class="caps">PROTEIN</span>.<br />
The more fat, and the earlier in the meal, the less the glycemic response. Eat good fat,<br />
preferably as an appetizer before the entrée. I now eat four Brazil nuts and one tablespoon of<br />
almond butter first thing upon waking</p>
<p><span class="caps">CINNAMON</span>, <span class="caps">EVEN</span> IN <span class="caps">SMALL</span> <span class="caps">DOSES</span>, <span class="caps">HAS</span> A <span class="caps">SUBSTANTIAL</span> <span class="caps">EFFECT</span> ON <span class="caps">GLUCOSE</span> <span class="caps">LEVELS</span>.</p>
<p>Eat more slowly<br />
lost 18 pounds with one change: chewing each mouthful of food 20 times.</p>
<p>The beautiful<br />
people of Buenos Aires might eat a wide spectrum of garbage calories, but they tend to do<br />
it in small bites and over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Make 30 minutes the minimum for a meal.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">FASTEST</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span>-<span class="caps">LOSS</span>, <span class="caps">MINIMIZE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BLOOD</span> <span class="caps">SUGAR</span> <span class="caps">BUMPS</span> <span class="caps">ABOVE</span> 100 TO NO <span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">THAN</span> <span class="caps">TWO</span> <span class="caps">PER</span> <span class="caps">DAY</span>.</p>
<p>Eat decent quantities of fat at each larger meal. Saturated fat is fine if meat is untreated with<br />
antibiotics and hormones.<br />
Spend at least 30 minutes eating lunch and dinner. Breakfasts can be smaller and thus<br />
consumed more quickly.</p>
