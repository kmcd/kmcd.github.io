financial instutions. When he tried complex strategies they all failed!</p>
<p>Use the simpliest strategy possible</p>
<p>It is important not to have a need for immediate profits to sustain your<br />
daily living, as strategies have intrinsic rates of returns that cannot<br />
be hurried</p>
<p>You should hope to have steadily increasing profits, but most likely it won’t be <br />
200 percent a year</p>
<p>Some fund managers spend 1 day a month monitoring reports &amp; news, setting up the<br />
days trades.</p>
<p>Author spends 2 hours in the morning reading reports &amp; preparind days trading.<br />
&gt; I&#8217;m looking for a 100% automated system</p>
<p>you will need to spend time doing research and backtesting on new strategies.</p>
<p>The Nonnecessity of Marketing</p>
<ul>
	<li>the business of quantitative trading</li>
	<li>allows you to focus exclusively on your product (the strategy and</li>
	<li>the software), and not on anything that has to do with influencing</li>
	<li>other people’s perception of yourself.</li>
	<li>&gt; This is <span class="caps">HUGE</span>!</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you find the right<br />
strategy to trade? How do you recognize a good versus a bad strat-<br />
egy even before devoting any time to backtesting them? How do you<br />
rigorously backtest them? If the backtest performance is good, what<br />
steps do you need to take to implement the strategy, in terms of both<br />
the business structure and the technological infrastructure?</p>
<p>= ch. 2 Fishing for Ideas</p>
<p>Many academic strategies are too complex, out of date or expensive to test.</p>
<p>many traders’ forums or blogs may suggest simpler strategies that are equally profitable<br />
strategies from traders’ forums may have worked only for a little while, or they<br />
work for only a certain class of stocks, or they work only if you<br />
don’t factor in transaction costs.</p>
<p>the difficulty is not the lack of ideas. The difficulty is to de-<br />
velop a taste for which strategy is suitable for your personal circum-<br />
stances and goals, and which ones look viable even before you de-<br />
vote the time to diligently backtest them</p>
<p>Low capital a/c&#8217;s (<span class="caps">YOU</span>)</p>
<p>With a low-capital account, we need to find strategies that can<br />
utilize the maximum leverage available. (Of course, getting a higher<br />
leverage is beneficial only if you have a consistently profitable<br />
&gt; Leverage = risk</p>
<p>Capital availability also imposes a number of indirect con-<br />
straints. It affects how much you can spend on various infrastructure, data, &amp; <br />
software.</p>
<p>Author uses Interactive Brokers</p>
<p>Backtesting data with surviourship bias may be acceptable to test Intra day <br />
strategies</p>
<p>&gt; Intra day scalping seems to be the strategy for me</p>
<p>the<br />
more regularly you want to realize profits and generate income, the<br />
shorter your holding period should be.</p>
<p>Sharpe ration is: <br />
average exces Returns / std dev excess<br />
where excess = portfolio &#8211; benchmark<br />
or how consistently does the portfolio perform</p>
<p>Bollinger bands: every time the price exceeds plus or minus<br />
2 moving standard deviations of its moving average, short or buy, re-<br />
spectively.</p>
<p>What are your transaction costs (see IB api)</p>
<p>A historical database of stock prices that does not include stocks<br />
that have disappeared due to bankruptcies, delistings, mergers, or<br />
acquisitions suffer from the so-called survivorship bias, because<br />
only “survivors” of those often unpleasant events remain in the<br />
database.</p>
<p>This is especially true if the strategy has a “value” bent; that is,<br />
it tends to buy stocks that are cheap.</p>
<p>it is very likely that you can optimize parameters in such a way that<br />
the historical performance will look fantastic. It is also very likely<br />
that the future performance of this strategy will look nothing like<br />
its historical performance and will turn out to be very poor.</p>
<p>Every time a carefully constructed model that seems to work marvels<br />
in backtest came up, they inevitably performed miserably going forward. The<br />
main reason for this seems to be that the amount of statistically independent<br />
financial data is far more limited compared to the billions of independent con-<br />
sumer and credit transactions available</p>
<p>The AI strategies that work for me are usually characterized by these properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li>based on a sound econometric or rational basis, and not on random discovery of patterns.</li>
	<li>few parameters that need to be fitted to past data.</li>
	<li>linear regression only, and not fitting to some esoteric non-linear functions.</li>
	<li>conceptually simple.</li>
	<li>All optimizations must occur in a lookback moving window, involving no future</li>
	<li>unseen data. And the effect of this optimization must be continuously demonstrated using this future, unseen data.</li>
</ul>
<p>look for those strategies that fly under the radar of most institutional investors</p>
<ul>
	<li>have very low capacities because they trade too often,</li>
	<li>trade very few stocks every day,</li>
	<li>have very infrequent positions (such as some seasonal trades in commodity</li>
	<li>futures described in Chapter 7).</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Those niches are the ones that are likely still to be profitable because</li>
	<li>they have not yet been completely arbitraged away by the gigantic</li>
	<li>hedge funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parametersless trading:  all parameters are dynamically optimized in a moving <br />
lookback window</p>

</ul>
<p>Backtesting is about conducting a realistic historical simulation of<br />
the performance of a strategy. The hope is that the future perfor-<br />
mance of the strategy will resemble its past performance</p>
<p>Data: Split/dividend adjustments, noise in daily high/low, and<br />
survivorship bias.</p>
<p>Performance measurement: Annualized Sharpe ratio and maxi-<br />
mum drawdown.</p>
<p>Look-ahead bias: Using unobtainable future information for past<br />
trading decisions.</p>
<p>Data-snooping bias: Using too many parameters to fit historical<br />
data, and avoiding it using large enough sample, out-of-sample<br />
testing, and sensitivity analysis.</p>

Strategy refinement: Common ways to make small variations on<br />

<p>= ch. 4 Setting up your business</p>
<p>Minimising transactions costs</p>
<p>To cut down on commissions, you can refrain from trading low-<br />
price stocks. Typically, institutional traders do not trade any stocks<br />
with prices lower than $5. Not only do low-price stocks increase<br />
your total commissions costs (since you need to buy or sell more<br />
shares for a fixed amount of capital), percentage-wise they also have<br />
a wider bid-ask spread and therefore increase your total liquidity<br />
costs.</p>
<p>In order to minimize market impact cost, you should limit the<br />
size (number of shares) of your orders based on the liquidity of the<br />
stock. One common measure of liquidity is the average daily volume<br />
(it is your choice what lookback period you want to average over).<br />
As a rule of thumb, each order should not exceed 1 percent of the<br />
average daily volume.</p>
<p>Often, the moment you start paper trading you will realize that<br />
there is a glaring look-ahead bias in your strategy—there may just be<br />
no way you could have obtained some crucial piece of data before<br />
you enter an order! If this happens, it is “back to the drawing board.”</p>
<p>You should be able run your <span class="caps">ATS</span>, execute paper trades, and then<br />
compare the paper trades and profit and loss (P&amp;L) with the theoret-<br />
ical ones generated by your backtest program using the latest data.<br />
If the difference dais not due to transaction costs (including an ex-<br />
pected delay in execution for the paper trades), then your software<br />
likely has bugs.</p>
<p>If you are able to run a paper trading system for a month or<br />
longer, you may even be able to discover data-snooping bias, since<br />
paper trading is a true out-of-sample test.</p>
<p>traders usually pay less and less attention to the performance of a paper trading<br />
system as time goes on, since there are always more pressing issues<br />
(such as the real trading programs that are being run). This inatten-<br />
tion causes the paper trading system to perform poorly because of<br />
neglect and errors in operation. So data-snooping bias can usually<br />
be discovered only when you have actually started trading the sys-<br />
tem with a small amount of capital.</p>
<p>Regime shifts refer to the situation when the financial market<br />
structure or the macroeconomic environment undergoes a drastic<br />
change so much so that trading strategies that were profitable be-<br />
fore may not be profitable now.</p>
<p>eg decimalization of stock prices. Prior to early<br />
2001, stock prices in the United States were quoted in multiples of<br />
one-sixteenth and one-eighteenth of a penny. Since April 9, 2001, all<br />
U.S. stocks have been quoted in decimals.</p>
<p>= ch. 6 Money &amp; Risk management</p>
<p>Every optimization problem begins with an objective.</p>
<p>Kelly formula (optimal leverage for a trading strategy)</p>
<p>true (geometric) random walk, by which<br />
I mean there is a 50–50 chance that the stock is going up 1 percent or<br />
down 1 percent every minute.<br />
you will lose money, at the rate of 0.005 percent (or<br />
0.5 basis point) every minute! This is because for a geometric random walk,<br />
the average compounded rate of return is not the short-term (or one-period)<br />
return m (0 here), but is g = m − s 2 /2.</p>
<p>it is extremely helpful to<br />
have a collaborator or consultant to duplicate your backtest results<br />
independently to ensure their validity. This need to duplicate results<br />
is routinely done in scientific research and is no less essential in<br />
financial research.<br />
&gt; IndieQuant.org</p>
<p>“representativeness bias”—people tend to put too much weight on<br />
recent experience and underweight long-term average</p>
<p>We must remember that we are operating in a probabilistic<br />
regime: No system can avoid all the market vagaries that can result<br />
in losses.</p>
<p>start with a small portfolio and gradually gain psychological preparedness, <br />
discipline, and confidence in your models.</p>
<p>In order to proceed slowly and cautiously, it<br />
is helpful to have other sources of income or other businesses to<br />
help sustain yourself either financially or emotionally (to avoid the<br />
boredom associated with slow progress). It is indeed possible that<br />
finding a diversion, whether income producing or not, may actually<br />
help improve the long-term growth of your wealth.</p>
<p>Position entry signals: decide when to buy<br />
Exit strategy: when to sell</p>
<ul>
	<li>A fixed holding period</li>
	<li>A target price or profit cap</li>
	<li>The latest entry signals</li>
	<li>A stop price</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>One of the most intuitive commodity seasonal trades is the<br />
gasoline future trade: Simply buy the gasoline future contract that<br />
expires in May near the middle of April, and sell it by the end<br />
of April. This trade has been profitable for the last 11 years, as<br />
of this writing in April 2008. (See the sidebar for details.) It ap-<br />
pears that one can always depend on approaching summer driv-<br />
ing seasons in North America to drive up gasoline futures prices in<br />
the spring.<br />
&gt; This is an example of the kind of stategy you should employ:</li>
	<li>based on economic reality</li>
	<li>easy to understand</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">HIGH</span>-<span class="caps">FREQUENCY</span> <span class="caps">TRADING</span> <span class="caps">STRATEGIES</span></p>
<p>The reason why these strategies have Sharpe ratio is simple:<br />
Based on the “law of large numbers,” the more bets you can place,<br />
the smaller the percent deviation from the mean return you will<br />
experience.</p>
<p>aim to exploit tiny inefficiencies in the market</p>
<p>inefficiencies and need for liquidity persist<br />
day to day, allowing consistent daily profits to be made. Further-<br />
more, high-frequency strategies typically trade securities in mod-<br />
est sizes. Without large positions to unwind, risk management for<br />
high-frequency portfolios is fairly easy: “Deleveraging” can be done<br />
very quickly in the face of losses, and certainly one can stop trad-<br />
ing and be completely in cash when the going gets truly rough. The<br />
worst that can happen as these strategies become more popular is a<br />
slow death as a result of gradually diminishing returns. Sudden dras-<br />
tic losses are not likely, nor are contagious losses across multiple<br />
accounts.</p>
<p>Though successful high-frequency strategies have such numer-<br />
ous merits, it is not easy to backtest such strategies when the<br />
average holding period decreases to minutes or even seconds.<br />
Transaction costs are of paramount importance in testing such<br />
strategies. Without incorporating transactions, the simplest strate-<br />
gies may seem to work at high frequencies. As a consequence, just<br />
having high-frequency data with last prices is not sufficient—data<br />
with bid, ask, and last quotes is needed to find out the profitability<br />
of executing on the bid versus the ask. Sometimes, we may even<br />
need historical order book information for backtesting. Quite often,<br />
the only true test for such strategies is to run it in real-time unless<br />
one has an extremely sophisticated simulator.</p>
<p>High-speed execution may account for a large part of the actual profits or losses.</p>
<p>(To recap: Capacity is the amount of equity a strat-<br />
egy can generate good returns on.) It is far, far easier to generate<br />
a high Sharpe ratio trading a $100,000 account than a $100 million<br />
account. There are many simple and profitable strategies that can<br />
work at the low capacity end that would be totally unsuitable to<br />
hedge funds. This is the niche for independent traders</p>
