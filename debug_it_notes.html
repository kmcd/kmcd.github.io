   <p>The Core Debugging Process</p>
<p>Reproduce:<br />
	Find a way to reliably and conveniently reproduce the problem on<br />
	demand.<br />
Diagnose:<br />
	Construct hypotheses, and test them by performing experiments<br />
	until you are confident that you have identified the underlying<br />
	cause of the bug.<br />
Fix:<br />
	Design and implement changes that fix the problem, avoid intro-<br />
	ducing regressions, and maintain or improve the overall quality of<br />
	the software.<br />
Reflect:<br />
	Learn the lessons of the bug. Where did things go wrong? Are there<br />
	any other examples of the same problem that will also need fixing?<br />
	What can you do to ensure that the same problem doesn’t happen<br />
	again?</p>
<p>Find a reproduction before doing anything else.<br />
	• Ensure that you’re running the same version as the bug was<br />
	reported against.<br />
	• Duplicate the environment that the bug was reported in.<br />
	• Determine the input necessary to reproduce the bug by:<br />
	– Inference<br />
	– Recording appropriate inputs via logging<br />
	• Ensure that your reproduction is both reliable and convenient<br />
	through iterative refinement:<br />
	– Reduce the number of steps, amount of data, or time<br />
	required.<br />
	– Remove nondeterminism.<br />
	– Automate.</p>
<p>Scientific method:<br />
	1. Examine what you know about the software’s behavior, and con-<br />
	struct a hypothesis about what might cause it.<br />
	2. Design an experiment that will allow you to test its truth (or oth-<br />
	erwise).<br />
	3. If the experiment disproves your hypothesis, come up with a new<br />
	one, and start again.<br />
	4. If it supports your hypothesis, keep coming up with experiments<br />
	until you have either disproved it or reached a high enough level<br />
	of certainty to consider it proven.</p>
<p>One Change at a Time</p>
<p>Keep a Record of What You’ve Tried &amp; periodically review</p>
<p>Binary chop</p>
<p>Favour tests to debugging sessions</p>
<p>Know what assumptions you’re making, and examine them critically.</p>
<p>Pair programming, ask for help. If no-one esle is available, write down the<br />
scenario and re-read it to yourself.</p>
<p>If you find yourself getting frustrated or thrashing (lots of action but<br />
little forward progress), that can be a sign that you need to take a break.<br />
Work on a different problem for a while, make a cup of tea, take a walk,<br />
practice your juggling for a while—anything that will take your mind off<br />
the problem.</p>
<p>When the stroke of genius arrives out of nowhere, write it down. If a<br />
pen and paper isn’t available, send yourself an <span class="caps">SMS</span> or tell whoever you<br />
happen to be with—there’s nothing more frustrating than being unable<br />
to recall your insight the following day.</p>
<p>Construct hypotheses, and test them with experiments.<br />
	– Make sure you understand what your experiments are going to tell you.<br />
	– Make only one change at a time.<br />
	– Keep a record of what you’ve tried.<br />
	– Ignore nothing.<br />
• When things aren’t going well:<br />
	– If the changes you’re making don’t seem to be having an effect, you’re not changing what you think you are.<br />
	– Validate your assumptions.<br />
	– Are you facing multiple interacting causes or a changing underlying system?<br />
• Validate your diagnosis.</p>
