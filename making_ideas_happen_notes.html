   <p>= Questions</p>
<p>When was this published?</p>
<p>What is the action method?  &#8211; Only manage 5 projects in total &#8211; Prioritise<br />
by &#8220;energy level&#8221; &#8211; Create action points for each project &#8211; Don&#8217;t research<br />
excessively, instead complete tasks that bring you closer to your goal</p>
<p>What are the takeaways?  &#8594; start blogging &amp; creating side projects to market<br />
yourself &#8594; eliminate your distractions or insecurity work &#8594; find or create<br />
a peer group (meetup or online) &#8594; in-person networks are more beneficial<br />
than online &#8594; create a workflow for your projects &#8594; excessive research<br />
is insecurity &#8594; timebox your research &amp; extract only what is actionable &#8594;<br />
focus on continuous, incremental progress</p>
<p>What is <span class="caps">ACTIONABLE</span>?  &#8594; start blogging &#8594; create a kanban system</p>
<p>Is this just for ideas or useful for product development?  &#8594; ideas are<br />
product development &#8594; product workflow: idea, market research, lead gen test</p>
<p>Are any patterns or principles apparent?  &#8211; flow &#8211; lean process control</p>
<p>Does this remind you of anything else?  &#8211; Enchantment by Guy Kawasaki -<br />
37 signals</p>
<p>How can this help market testing?  &#8211; speed up by executing in paralell</p>
<p>How can this help self promotion?  &#8211; find other communities to engage in</p>
<p>What is the most appropriate workflow/process for Making Ideas Happen?  -<br />
idea generation &#8211; critical research &#8211; (market) test</p>
<p>Does organisation imply division of labour?  &#8211; Yes. You can&#8217;t do everything<br />
(Walling). Employ people to perform lower value tasks.</p>
<p>What are my ongoing projects?  &#8211; biz testing &#8211; songwriting &#8211; fat loss</p>
<p>Does this mean you can only complete 2 action steps per day using the 4hWW<br />
method?  &#8211; No. One high value item could have many action steps. Perhaps<br />
you shouldn&#8217;t decompose tasks down which will take less than 1/2 day.</p>
<p>Am I guilty of bearaucracy with Customer development?  &#8211; Quite possibly. Focus<br />
on parallell execution (market research, talking to customers, adwords<br />
lead gen).  &#8211; Ease off on the book research &amp; note taking &#8211; Always extract<br />
actionable points &#8211; Time box &amp; blog about market research</p>
<p>Is reading this book insecurity that I&#8217;m not doing it right?  &#8594; :)<br />
Probably. How much value was gained from the last 1.5 hrs.?  The main value<br />
is that it re-inforced the need to self promote.</p>
<p>= Notes</p>
<p>Making ideas happen = Ideas + Organization + Communal forces + Leadership<br />
capability.</p>
<p>many of us spend too much energy searching for the next great idea, my<br />
research shows that we would be better served by developing the capacity to<br />
make ideas happen—a capacity that endures over time.</p>
<p>The way you organize projects, prioritize, and manage your energy is arguably<br />
more important than the quality of the ideas you wish to pursue</p>
<p>The utilization of communal forces yields invaluable feedback and idea<br />
refinement, builds and nourishes beneficial relationships, and establishes<br />
a connective tissue that provides resources, support, and inspiration.</p>
<p>For each idea, you must capture and highlight your “Action Steps.”<br />
(Sounds like dream lining from 4 hour work week)</p>
<p>excessive note taking actually interferes with the bias toward action that<br />
is necessary for a productive creative environment. If you simply capture<br />
and then tend to the actions required for a project, you are already way<br />
ahead of the game. [<span class="caps">NOVEL</span>]</p>
<p>Action Steps are the specific, concrete tasks that inch you forward:</p>
<p>References are any project-related handouts, sketches, notes, meeting minutes,<br />
manuals, Web sites, or ongoing discussions that you may want to refer back<br />
to. It is important to note that References are not actionable—they are<br />
simply there for reference when focusing on any particular project.</p>
<p>Finally, there are Backburner Items, things that are not actionable now but<br />
may be someday</p>
<p>Capture Action Steps everywhere</p>
<p>An unowned Action Step will never be taken.</p>
<p>You must find ways, using modern technology if possible, to manage the<br />
References of your projects without compromising the precious energy you<br />
have for what is actionable.</p>
<p>Always measure with Action Steps</p>
<p>Action steps <span class="caps">FLOW</span> &#8211; capture in real time (like <span class="caps">GTD</span>) &#8211; process periodically<br />
in batches</p>
<p>Place your projects along an energy line according to how much energy they<br />
should receive.</p>
<p>A project placed at the “Extreme” end of the energy line should be the<br />
most important for the time being—worthy of the majority of your energy.</p>
<p>Is this another &#8220;productivity&#8221; method? Action points are a useful way to<br />
decompose a project, but is the pre-mortem more effective?</p>
<p>Create windows of nonstimulation (37 signals alone time)</p>
<p>Avoid the tendency to escape the lulls of the project plateau by developing<br />
new ideas.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy was born out of the human desire for complete assurance before<br />
taking action. When we don’t want to take action, we find reasons to<br />
wait. We use “waiting” nicknames like “awaiting approval,” “following<br />
procedures,” “further research,” or “consensus building.” However,<br />
even when the next step is unclear, the best way to figure it out is to take<br />
some incremental action. Constant motion is the key to execution.</p>
<p>you should create an environment that allows premature action. Whether you<br />
work alone or with a team, a commitment to early action—without too much<br />
conviction—will help ideas materialize</p>
<p>Create windows of nonstimulation.</p>
<p>1. Idea generation 2. aggregate, organise 3. critically review the project<br />
without restraint</p>
<p>Embrace constraints</p>
<p>the “Done Wall” is a piece of art that reminds us of the progress we have<br />
made thus far.  &#8594; would you be more productive by relentlessly focussing<br />
on todo?  &#8594; or is this a good way to learn from past mistakes?</p>
<p>Find a way to organise your thoughts.  &#8211; create a visual workspace -<br />
writing can be an effective way to organise your thoughts &#8211; read a critical<br />
thinking book</p>
<p>“You can only organize something if you understand how it works,”</p>
<p>organizing life into a series of projects, managing those projects with a bias<br />
toward action, and always moving the ball forward are critical for execution.</p>
<p>He uses the example of writers to illustrate how creative people organise<br />
their work day.  &#8594; Can you use the methods precribed in &#8220;Becoming a Writer&#8221;<br />
[Brande] instead? ie Write 1st thing in the morning, be observant, find a<br />
way get into the flow.</p>
<p>Sheer perspiration will come only from organizing your energy and holding<br />
yourself accountable with some sort of routine.</p>
<p>daily (and in some cases hourly) habits “Insecurity Work.” It’s the stuff<br />
you do that has no intended outcome, does not move the ball forward in any way,<br />
and is quick enough that you can do it multiple times a day without realizing<br />
how much time is being wasted. While all of these actions are important once<br />
in a while, there is no rational reason to perform them so often.</p>
<p>constant need for assurance becomes a shackle on your productivity.  we are<br />
always wondering what we are missing.  pay attention to where your focus<br />
wanders when you’re distracted from the project at hand.  Delegate necessary<br />
insecurity work.  Excessive or unnecessary checking</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">COMMUNITY</span> IS all around you—your team, mentors, clients or customers,<br />
collaborators, and of course your family and friends.</p>
<p>An article in the February 2009 issue of the Harvard Business Review cited<br />
a recent <span class="caps">MIT</span> study showing that employees with the most extensive personal<br />
online networks were 7 percent more productive than their colleagues, and those<br />
with the most cohesive face-to-face networks were 30 percent more productive.</p>
<p>Doers, Dreamers, and Incrementalists all have their own strengths and<br />
limitations. However, once you consider which type you might be, you can<br />
leverage the forces around you—potential partnerships, organizational tools,<br />
and other resources—that can make all the difference</p>
<p>Starting in the year 2000, Kalmikoff and Nickell grew Threadless from a<br />
small side project into a $35 million business. Dreamer + Doer partnership</p>
<p>Should you find a partner or remain solo? A soloist by definition must be<br />
a polymath/incrementalist.</p>
<p>Share liberally Anderson uses his blog to share and “beta test” the<br />
ideas that go into his books.  most ideas die in isolation because they are<br />
not shared and, as a consequence, are ultimately forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;work naked&#8221;:  your ability to make use of many of the benefits that your<br />
community can provide for you depends on how transparent you are with<br />
your ideas, objectives, and progress.  (37 Signals: behind the curtain,<br />
Guy Kawasaki: factory tour)</p>
<p>Create your own circle, like a writers circle, as a peer review group. Rob<br />
Walling calls this a mastermind group.</p>
<p>Meet frequently and stay accountable.</p>
<p>Competition is a powerful motivating force.</p>
<p>Work amidst other fields of expertise</p>
<p>On January 12, 2007, the Washington Post conducted a rather odd experiment<br />
involving a $3.5 million Stradivarius violin, a Washington, D.C., Metro<br />
station, and Joshua Bell, arguably one of the most famous and critically<br />
acclaimed violinists in the world.  A few days earlier, Bell had performed<br />
at Boston’s Symphony Hall, where even the cheap tickets go for a hundred<br />
bucks apiece. But on this winter day, at the height of the morning commute,<br />
Bell positioned himself in the busy L’Enfant Plaza Metro station, dressed<br />
in street clothes and a baseball cap, and played some of the finest classical<br />
pieces ever written, such as the Chaconne from Johann Sebastian Bach’s<br />
Partita no. 2 in D Minor, and Franz Schubert’s “Ave Maria.”</p>
<p>As Bell delivered a virtuosic performance, more than a thousand busy commuters<br />
rushed past him on their way to work. Nearly every single one failed<br />
to appreciate his skill, and only a single person recognized him. After<br />
playing for forty-three minutes, Bell had collected only $32.17. In short,<br />
his precious gift went largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>&#8594; What does this tell us? Context is key?</p>
<p>When you work alone, you don’t have a marketing department or a team<br />
of people to make sales calls. “Freelancers need to spend half of their<br />
time marketing themselves and the other half doing their work,” Horowitz<br />
explained. Without marketing, freelancers aren’t adequately showcasing<br />
their capabilities, which can result in a drought of new clients.</p>
<p>Once you accept responsibility for marketing yourself, you can start to<br />
mine for opportunities. Learn to showcase your skills and expertise without<br />
an invitation.</p>
<p>A good self-marketing strategy should start with intrinsic interests that<br />
can become personal projects—projects that demonstrate your strengths.</p>
<p>The ability to gather and present your past accomplishments visually in a<br />
“show, don’t tell” framework is much more effective than having a list<br />
of clients or distributing a resumé</p>
<p>Identify your differentiating attributes.</p>
<p>Develop a communications strategy. Once you have identified your<br />
differentiating attributes, you will want to identify the reasons they can<br />
serve as strengths.</p>
<p>Execute your communications strategy.</p>
<p>One of the best things you can do for your ideas is develop the capacity<br />
to tune in to the perspectives of others—and to help others tune in to<br />
yours. Interaction, whether it is with an individual or an audience, can be<br />
maximized by understanding who you are talking to. What excites them? What<br />
are they worried about? Just synthesizing this information will help you<br />
further engage those around you.</p>
<p>Lee’s fundamental secret for staying loyal to projects both in and out<br />
of the office is incorporating “an element of fun.”. This reminds<br />
me of the developer who learns a new technology when starting a business.<br />
How can we turn it into a game? Adwords might be good for this.  Attending &amp;<br />
presenting at conferences once a month would be a good reward.</p>
<p>Practice restraint with your ideas (like Steve Blanks interview technique:<br />
talk about the problem).  Patience in the face of ambiguity helps us avoid<br />
brash decisions driven by our emotions instead of our intellects.</p>
<p>Reconsider your approach to mentoring.</p>
<p>Distinguish past accomplishments from present knowledge. We all have a<br />
tendency to “rest on our laurels,” but cutting-edge knowledge becomes<br />
antiquated very quickly.</p>
<p>Aspire to better practices, not the best.</p>

<p>= Summary</p>
<p>Your ideas will not happen unless you have an effective process to <sub>make</sub><br />
them happen. This includes building an audience for your ideas.</p>
<p>Share your ideas to build an audience and elict feedback.</p>
<p>As a freelancer you must showcase your talent to prevent a drought of work.</p>
<p>Broaden your horizons by tuning in to other communities. You can do this by<br />
attending conferences &amp; participating online.</p>
<p>Excessive note taking &amp; reseach will decrease your productivtiy. Instead,<br />
extract the action points from referenence material.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of idea project artifact: action points, references &amp;<br />
backburner. References include background reading, sketches.</p>
<p>Create visual workspace without distractions and free from interruption.</p>
