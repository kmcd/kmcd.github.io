      <h1>Scrum at Plazes</h1>

<p class='author'>Written by <a href="index.html">Keith McDonnell</a>. Last updated on

<div class='content'>                                 
   <p>While I was working as a freelance, Ruby on Rails contractor, I recieved an offer to move to Berlin to work for <a href="http://plazes.com/">Plazes</a> . They were looking for a buyer and needed to re-vamp the app for potential aquirers.</p>
<h2>Project management in situ</h2>
<p>On my I arrival I teamed up with 3 backend developers, 1 front end developer and 2 UI designers. There software process I found was chaotic, ad hoc and relying on individual heroics to meet delivery dates.</p>
<p>So, I introduced the team to Scrum with a 30 min. presentation and printed off number copies of <a href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/ScrumAndXpFromTheTrenches.pdf">Scrum and XP from the trenches</a> . They loved it and the team agreed to fortnighly iterations.</p>
<h2>Planning session</h2>
<p>Our first planning session was straightforward and took the whole team for 30 mins. The <span class="caps">CEO</span> assumed the role of product owner while I was Scrum master.</p>
<ol>
	<li>List all feature ideas &amp; bugs (one sentence on an index card)</li>
	<li>Prioritise based on percived usefulness to the end user</li>
	<li>Estimate the <span class="caps">DIFFICULTY</span> of each feature (1:easy, 5:hard) aka story points</li>
	<li>Guess how many we can do in 2 weeks</li>
	<li>Ensure all delelopers have even workload</li>
	<li>Last chance to change the next 2 weeks work</li>
</ol>
<h2>2 week iterations</h2>
<p>Next I set up the Scrum board exactly as described in <a href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/ScrumAndXpFromTheTrenches.pdf">Scrum and XP from the trenches</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://rndsolutions.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/scrum_and_xp1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The daily stand up consisted of the usual questions;</p>
<ol>
	<li>What I did yesterday</li>
	<li>What I did yesterday</li>
	<li>Any impedimets</li>
</ol>
<p>After the stand up I updated the burndown with any completed features. At the end of the fortnight we had a show and tell as seen below. We followed up the demo with a retrospective to figure out what worked and what didn&#8217;t.</p>

<h2>Retrospectives</h2>
<p>Use the nokia test to help structure your retrospectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Iterations must be timeboxed to less than 4 weeks</li>
	<li>Software features must be tested and working at the end of each iteration</li>
	<li>The Iteration must start before specification is complete</li>
	<li>You know who the product owner is</li>
	<li>There is a product backlog prioritized by business value</li>
	<li>The product backlog has estimates created by the team</li>
	<li>The team generates burndown charts and knows their velocity</li>
	<li>There are no project managers (or anyone else) disrupting the work of the team</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to step 1 (planning) and repeat!</p>
<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep the daily stand up quick, really quick &#8211; 60 seconds max. per person</li>
	<li>Agressively remove impediments immediately after the stand up</li>
	<li>Again, keep the demo &amp; planning quick. Say 20 &#8211; 30 mins.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Alls well that ends well. During my tenure, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/23/breaking-germanys-plazes-acquired-by-nokia/">Plazes closed the deal with Nokia</a> in August. The <span class="caps">CEO</span> congratulated the team, saying the re-launch and new features played a large part in closing the deal.</p>
