<p>== Notes</p>
<p>ch 1: It&#8217;s all about desire</p>
<p>Easier to fulfill existing demand than create new demand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about desire</p>
<p>Find most powerful desire &amp; acknowledge/Reinforce/Satisfy</p>
<p>Find the <span class="caps">ONE</span> dominant benefit<br />
And make sure it is <span class="caps">UNIQUE</span><br />
And that is your lead<br />
Stress Benefits not Features</p>
<p>1. What is the mass desire that motivates your market?  <br />
2. How much does your market know about your product?  (Their State of Awareness.) <br />
3. How many similar products have they been told about before?</p>
<p>ch 2: prospects state of awareness</p>
<p>Wants Benefit; Doesn&#8217;t Know of Product<br />
- Focus emotion and give it a goal<br />
- Crystalize Desire into a catchphrase</p>
<p>Has a Need; Doesn&#8217;t See connection to product<br />
- Problem solving ad<br />
- Connection to Product<br />
- Name Need/Solution<br />
- crystalise/dramatise need<br />
- make product the only solution</p>
<p>ch 3: Market type</p>
<p>First in Market<br />
- New Technology<br />
- Repurpose Prod<br />
- New Medium<br />
- New Performance/Benefits<br />
- Be Simple, Be Direct!</p>
<p>What market type am I? Existing (performance enhancement on existing delivery methods)</p>
<p>Mature market<br />
- New delivery or mechanisms</p>
<p>ch 4: Stronger headlines</p>
<p>=&gt; Use examples of most popular affilliate ads from Adwords book</p>
<p>ch 5: growing headline ideas</p>
<p>Strenghtening your headline</p>
<p>Key Point: Find the <span class="caps">ONE</span> Vital Fact &#8211; Generality is Death</p>
<p>Motivation/Market Research: Know your prospect intimately &#8211; test smaller ideas</p>
<p>(Learn Rails/Be a Rails developer) in (6 hours / one day)</p>
<p>You have now built vour headline.  You now have a means of stopping your<br />
prospect—of bringing to a momentary halt all the diverse activities of<br />
his mind—of focussing his attention, at least for a moment, on a single<br />
thought.  This is the job that you have designed vour headline to do—not<br />
to sell, or identify your product, or even mention the need or desire that<br />
your product satisfies—but simply and solelv to flag down your prospect,<br />
and get him to read your first paragraph.  From that moment on, your body<br />
copy does the selling. It does this by altering your prospect&#8217;s vision of<br />
reality. It creates a new world for your prospect—a world in which your<br />
product emerges as the fulfillment of the dominant desire that caused this<br />
man to respond to your headline.</p>
<p>ch 6: Inside your prospects mind</p>
<p>Make them <span class="caps">WANT</span><br />
Deeper hope &amp; dreams<br />
Dont try to teach &#8211; make your case fit exisiting beliefs (ie dont enter a new market)</p>
<p>ch 7: Intensification &#8211; strenghten desire</p>
<p>Present claims<br />
First present the product or the<br />
satisfaction it gives directly—bluntly—by a thorough, completely detailed<br />
description of its appearance or the results it gives.</p>
<p>Put claims into action<br />
 To show, not only how the<br />
product looks, and what benefits it gives the reader, hut exactly how it<br />
does this.</p>
<p>Bring in the reader<br />
Or, if vour product lends itself to<br />
this kind of treatment, put your reader right smack in the middle of this<br />
product-in-action story, and give him a verbal demonstration of icJiat will<br />
happen to him the first day he owns that product.</p>
<p>Show Him H o w to Test Your Claims 4. But there is still more room to expand<br />
the image along these lines. Turn the demonstration into a test. Let your<br />
reader visualize himself proving the performance of your product—gaining<br />
its benefits immediately—in the most specific and dramatic way possible.</p>
<p>Bring In an Audience <br />
Tesimonials <br />
Case studies<br />
Well known people</p>
<p>Show reader testing limits</p>
<p>Show expert approval</p>
<p>Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority <br />
Each new approach suggests others. The<br />
competition can be carried into contrast. The disadvantages of the old<br />
product or service can he laid side by side with the advantages of the<br />
new— throwing these advantages into sharp relief.</p>
<p>Show how easy it is stressing the ease of application, and contrasting it with the <br />
tremendous benefits that that application gives you</p>
<p>Guarantee</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do what you do&#8221; &#8594; create cool apps, run side businessess, knock out <br />
web app quickly</p>
<p>A copy writer&#8217;s first<br />
qualifications are imagination and enthusiasm. You are literally the script<br />
writer for vour prospect&#8217;s dreams. Your<br />
job is to show him in minute detail all the tomorrows that vour product<br />
makes possible for him</p>
<p>ch. 8: Identification &#8211; fullfill deep desires</p>
<p>Charatcher</p>
<p>Achievement</p>
<p>Here display is vital—because none of these achievements is obvious. Quite<br />
the opposite, they are immaterial and invisible—mere titles, roles, bundles<br />
of privilege. But that potential must first be<br />
translated into physical symbols of success, for everyone around us to see</p>

<p>Identify with people &#8211; <span class="caps">YOU</span> (as trainer) and the people you associate yourself <br />
with. Get out there and hustle. Attend conference &amp; meetups for Rails/Ruby, <br />
business startups, graphic design, usability. Choose who you follow online.</p>
<p>The Roles Your Prospect Desires What, exactly, is this process of Identification? Quite<br />
simply, it is, first of all, the desire of your prospect to act out certain<br />
roles in his life.<br />
=&gt; Seth Godin: 37 signals are not selling software, they&#8217;re selling rebellion. <br />
Targeting unhappy office workers.</p>
<p>And how do you utilize this longing<br />
for identification when you write your copy? In two ways: First, bv turning<br />
your product into an instrument for achieving these roles. And second, by<br />
turning that product into an acknowledgement that these roles have already<br />
been achieved.</p>
<p>Every product you work on should offer vour prospect two<br />
separate and distinct reasons for buying it. First, it should offer him the<br />
fulfillment of a physical want or need. This is the satisfaction your product<br />
gives him. And second, it should offer him a particular method of fulfilling<br />
that need, that defines him to the outside world as a particular kind of<br />
human being</p>

<p>How else can people identify with your service? <br />
- Public web pages (White Belt alumni)<br />
- github a/c<br />
- blog<br />
- heroku apps</p>

<p>Dominant image for success &#8594; <span class="caps">SUCCESSFUL</span> apps &amp; businesses, achievement, cool, <br />
not nerdy, women.</p>
<p>ch. 9: Gradualisation</p>
<p>This process of<br />
starting with the facts that vour prospect is already willing to accept, and<br />
leading him logically and comfortably through a gradual succession of more and<br />
more remote facts—each of which he has been prepared in turn to accept—<br />
is called Gradualization.</p>
<p>The first of these dimensions is Desire—want, yearning, motivation—with<br />
specific goals and/or cures in mind—with the prospect begging to be<br />
shown how to obtain them. It is the copy writer&#8217;s job to make sure the<br />
path to these goals goes through the product—and to make sure that the<br />
prospect can visualize every drop of satisfaction that their achievement<br />
will give him.  The second dimension is Identification—the need for<br />
expression and recognition—unformulated, unspoken, at least partially<br />
unconscious—searching for symbols, definitions and embodiments. It is the<br />
copv writer&#8217;s job to crystallize these seldefinitions and emboch&#8217; them in his product—so that the product may be used,<br />
not only as a source of physical satisfaction, but also as a symbolic extension<br />
of the personality of the prospect for whom it is intended.</p>
<p>The need to believe— and the need for secure<br />
beliefs—is just as powerful an emotional force as the strongest desire for<br />
physical satisfaction, or the most urgent search for expression</p>
<p>one fully-believed claim will sell more goods than all the half-questioned<br />
promises vour competitors can write for all the rest of their days</p>
<p>What are &#8220;the facts&#8221; or beliefs of your prospects?</p>
That every claim, everv image, every proof in your
<p>ad has two separate sources of strength— <br />
1. The content of that statement<br />
itself;<br />
and <br />
2. The preparation vou have made for that statement—either by<br />
recognizing that preparation as already existing in your prospect&#8217;s mind,<br />
or bv deliberately laving the groundwork for that statement in the preceding<br />
portion of the ad itself.</p>
<p>And, because of this fact, we can strengthen the power of each of these <br />
statements in two separate ways—<br />
1. Bv increasing<br />
the intensity of its content—by making greater promises, bv portraying<br />
more dramatic images, by offering more compelling proof; <br />
and/or<br />
2. Bv changing the place or position or sequence in which that statement occurs<br />
in the ad—by strengthening the groundwork for belief in that statement<br />
by the material which precedes it—and therefore increasing the intensity<br />
of belief given to it— the immediate acceptance of its content, without<br />
question, when the prospect encounters it in vour ad.</p>
<p>New Definition of Awareness We now know that Gradualization is the art of <br />
starting your ad with a statement that will be immediately and<br />
entirely accepted, and then building a chain of subsequent acceptances upon<br />
this first statement.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chain of acceptances is to lead your<br />
reader to a goal conclusion, which he will then accept, but which he would not<br />
as readily or as thoroughly have accepted without the preliminary statements.</p>
<p>This quest for acceptance begins, of course, with vour headline. This<br />
all-important first statement that you make—this meeting place between your<br />
story and your prospect—must not only be capable of awakening interest<br />
and desire, but of being accepted at the very first glance as being true.</p>
<p>Interest and believability—these are the two requirements that determine<br />
your headline.</p>
<p>We have already discussed these requirements in Chapter 2,<br />
on the State of Awareness of our market.  We can now redefine this State of<br />
Awareness as readiness to accept.</p>
<p>And we can now say—especially in the<br />
Fifth Stage of Awareness—that the effectiveness of your headline is as<br />
much determined by the willingness of your audience to believe what it says,<br />
as it is by the promises it makes.  This is the reason that you cannot always<br />
use the most powerful claim in your headline. Or even the very problem that<br />
your product solves. Because without supporting evidence already existing<br />
in the mind of your prospect to prepare him for that headline claim, he<br />
just won&#8217;t believe it. Either he&#8217;ll believe that it&#8217;s exaggerated or false,<br />
or he just won&#8217;t believe it applies to him.</p>
<p>This fact—that your most powerful claim does not always<br />
make vour most powerful headline—is a paradox that many copy writers<br />
still cannot accept.</p>
<p>Gradualisation &#8594; aka tell a leading story, laying the ground work.</p>
<p>Unlock the power of Rails &#8594; keys to the kingdom</p>
<p>=&gt; What is the appropriate sequence of claims for RailsDojo?</p>
<p>=&gt; What are the existing beliefs for those wishing to learn Rails?</p>
<p>Gradulisation: <br />
Start: Learning Ruby is hard?<br />
Conclusion: I can teach you how to teach yourself.</p>
<p>Address the customers fears:<br />
- is this course any good<br />
- what if its not<br />
- who is this guy<br />
- will I be any better afterwards</p>
<p>1. To show how the goal-conclusion—the introduction of the product claim<br />
itself—may be made far more effective if it is delayed till the prospect has<br />
been prepared to accept it. And 2. To show how this full acceptance—this<br />
willingness to believe without question-can gradually be built up, layer<br />
by laver agreement by agreement, by use of the proper structure.</p>
<p>Add Believability By&#8230;<br />
Inclusion Question: &#8220;Have you ever&#8230;?&#8221;<br />
Detailed Identification:<br />
Laundry list of problems<br />
Contradiction: &#8220;It&#8217;s a new world&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Logic words: actually,therefore, discovered here&#8217;s why, proven by, in fact<br />
Syllogism: Build it up: &#8220;You know A is B And that means B is C. But now, C is D!&#8221;<br />
Others: If/then, echo strong proofs, pour on strong proof.</p>
<p>Mechanization: how does your product work?</p>
<p>#1—first:<br />
Here your mechanism is not so well known, or not known at all, and you can&#8217;t<br />
simply name it. You have to go into more detail; you have to describe it.<br />
So you have the classic situation of Promise—Reason Whv.  You build a<br />
strong, quick promise—and then you follow up with the reason why you can<br />
deliver that promise.</p>
