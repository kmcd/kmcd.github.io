      <h1>Dieter Rams design principles applied to software</h1>

   <p>I went to a <a href="http://designmuseum.org/design/dieter-rams">retrospective of Dieter Rams design work at the London Design meseum</a> during the summer. He&#8217;s the master of the simple, elegant and functional aesthetic. I could really see where Jonathan Ive gets his inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2008/01/rams-ive.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Quite helpfully, he came up with 10 design principles:</p>
<h2>Good design is &#8230;</h2>
<ul>
	<li>innovative</li>
	<li>a useful product</li>
	<li>aesthetic (has beauty)</li>
	<li>an understandable product</li>
	<li>unobtrusive</li>
	<li>honest</li>
	<li>long-lasting</li>
	<li>thorough down to the last detail</li>
	<li>environmentally friendly</li>
	<li>as little design as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>All very Zen, but how can we put this to good use in the software world ?</p>
<h2>Applied to user interface</h2>
<p>A <strong>useful</strong> user interface clearly presents the information without requiring interaction. In the UI context <strong>useful</strong> and <strong>understandable</strong> are synonymous. Read <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk">Magic Ink: Information Software and the Graphical Interface</a> by Bret Victor for more on the perils of interactivity. You can find out if your UI is useful by doing usability testing.</p>
<p>Dont rely on fashions or fads. Instead, try and understand the principles of graphic design such as layout, color, typography. If you use as <strong>little design as possible</strong> your interface should be <strong>long lasting</strong> in that it will never look out of date.</p>
<p>An <strong>unobtrusive</strong> design is free from unnecessary ornamentation. What Tufte would refer to as &#8220;administrative debris&#8221; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The idea is that the content is the interface, the information is the interface not computer administrative debris.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can really be ruthless in pruning here. See how <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/administrative-debris">Ryan Tomayko improved his website based on Tufte principles</a> .</p>
<p>I would agrees that <strong>aesthetic</strong> or beauty is important to good desgin. Despite the current trend for A/B tested hyper optimised pages. For one thing, it gives you pride in your work.</p>
<h2>Applied to software (code) design</h2>
<p>The first crtieria of well designed code is that it is actually <strong>useful</strong>. Trite though it may sound, it must do what it&#8217;s supposed to do without bugs.</p>
<p>Your code should be <strong>understandable</strong> by end users and developers. For end users, speak and understand <span class="caps">THEIR</span> language. Use as little jargon as possible. For developers, your code should read as close to pseudo-code as possbile.</p>
<p>As <strong>little design as possible</strong>. Amen to that. Don&#8217;t try and over-engineer your application and beware gold plating. Use design patterns and complex algorithms to solve a problem, not improve a solution.</p>
<p>How can you make your code <strong>long-lasting</strong>? By making it (a) easy to change and (b) resilient to failure. For example, (a) one of your vendors has gone bust and you have to replace a key piece of your architecture. You should have a layer of abstraction where you can plug in the new vendors code in <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">PLACE</span>. Similarly, your new vedor is flaky but solvent. You can mitigate this by (b) handling outages gracefully and storing missed calls in a queue and try again later.</p>
