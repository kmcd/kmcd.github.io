   <p>Kanban, David Anderson</p>
<p>= Skim</p>
<p>= Questions</p>
<p>What chapters should I omit? <br />
1, 13, 14, 16 &#8211; 20 (advanced)</p>
<p>What are the key / most applicable chapters?<br />
6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15<br />
From steps to implement, ch 6 &amp; 7 are mentioned repeatedly</p>
<p>Can I summarise with the takeaways sections only? Yes</p>
<p>Kanban will reveal opportunities for improvement that do not involve<br />
complex changes to engineering methods. <br />
&#8594; What are the low cost, high return activities?</p>
<p>How to measure the current system?<br />
&#8594; raw data from lighthouse api<br />
&#8594; model current workflow using value stream<br />
&#8594; model kanban pull system using a card board<br />
&#8594; <span class="caps">WIP</span>, thoughput, % billable time (key metric), total time from request to invoice</p>
<p>How long to see changes take effect?<br />
&#8594; review &amp; make changes at monthly ops meeting<br />
&#8594; original implementation took 15 months for max improvement</p>
<p>Can we use <span class="caps">WIP</span> limits on number of tickets per client release to enforce pair<br />
programming?<br />
&#8594; Dont impose policies, instead suggest solutions to problems as they arise</p>
<p>What are MS work item types?<br />
&#8594; support (admin/config) request<br />
&#8594; bug<br />
&#8594; feature (load failure)<br />
&#8594; new feature<br />
&#8594; UI change (including text chunk)</p>
<p>How can we perform a demand analysis of work item types using LightHouse api?<br />
Yes, for items that have a ticket. This does not measure time spend on phone calls,<br />
interruptions to current work, investigating issues on production.</p>
<p>What is the absolute minimum we can do to improve?<br />
Visualise workflow<br />
Limit <span class="caps">WIP</span><br />
Measure cycle time<br />
Start to focus on quality</p>
<p>Do we need a kanban board or can we manage soley with an electronic tool?<br />
Still don&#8217;t know the answer to this. Probably not.</p>
<p>What are the classes of service?<br />
&#8594; based on delivery time &amp; work item type<br />
&#8594; expidited   1 day<br />
&#8594; feature     15 days<br />
&#8594; bug         5 days<br />
&#8594; support     2 days</p>
<p>= Notes</p>
<p>== ch 2, What is a Kanban method?</p>
<p>Kanban (signal card)<br />
- represents a unit of capacity in a system<br />
- signalling mechanism, eg plane ticket (provides direction/instruction)</p>
<p>Imperial Palace Gardens admission tickets (effective, low cost solution)</p>
<p>use a kanban system to:<br />
- limit a team’s work-in-progress<br />
- set capacity<br />
- balance the demand against the throughput of delivered work. <br />
- enforce a sustainable pace of development<br />
- ensure work versus personal life balance.</p>
<p>== ch 3, Recipe for success</p>
<p>Goldratt, Theory of contraints:</p>
<p>1.	 Visualize Workflow<br />
2.	 Limit Work-in-Progress<br />
3.	 Measure and Manage Flow<br />
4.	 Make Process Policies Explicit<br />
5.	 Use Models to Recognize Improvement Opportunities</p>
<p>excessive defects are the biggest waste in software development</p>
<p>Focus on quality</p>

	<li></li>
	<li>create slack</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>You need slack to enable continuous improvement. In order to have slack, you</li>
	<li>must have an unbalanced value stream with a bottleneck resource. Optimizing</li>
	<li>for utilization is not desirable. (Queing theory, road traffic)</li>
</ul>

<p>== ch 15, Starting a Kanban change initiative</p>
<p>Steps to Get Started<br />
1.	 Agree on a set of goals for introducing Kanban.<br />
2.	 Map the value stream <br />
3.	 Define some point where you want to control input. Define what is</p>
<ul>
	<li>upstream of that point and who the upstream stakeholders are (explained</li>
	<li>in chapter 6). For example, do you wish to control requirements arriving</li>
	<li>to the design team pre-production? The upstream stakeholders might be</li>
	<li>product managers.<br />
4.	 Define some exit point beyond which you do not intend to control. Define</li>
	<li>what is downstream of that and who the downstream stakeholders are</li>
	<li>(explained in chapter 6). For example, maybe you don’t need to control</li>
	<li>the delivery fulfillment of the product.<br />
5.	 Define a set of work item types based on the types of work requests that</li>
	<li>come from the upstream stakeholders (explained in chapter 6). Do you</li>
	<li>have some item types that are time-sensitive and others that are not? If so,</li>
	<li>then you may require some classes of service (explained in chapter 11).<br />
6.	 Analyze the demand for each work item type. Observe the arrival rate</li>
	<li>and variation. Is the variation seasonal or event-driven? What risks are</li>
	<li>associated with this type of demand? Should the system be designed to</li>
	<li>cope with average or peak demand? What is the tolerance for late or unre-</li>
	<li>liable delivery of this type of work? Create a risk profile for the demand.</li>
	<li>(Explained in chapter 6.)<br />
7.	 Meet with the upstream and downstream stakeholders—this might be</li>
	<li>one big meeting, or it might be lots of little meetings. (Explained in more</li>
	<li>depth later in this chapter.)</li>
	<li>a.	 Discuss policies around capacity of the piece of the value stream you want</li>
	<li>to control and get agreement on a <span class="caps">WIP</span> limit (explained in chapter 10).</li>
	<li>b.	 Discuss and agree on an input-coordination mechanism, such as a</li>
	<li>regular prioritization meeting, with the upstream partners (explained</li>
	<li>in chapter 9).</li>
	<li>c.	 Discuss and agree on a release/delivery-coordination mechanism,</li>
	<li>such as a regular software release, with the downstream partners</li>
	<li>(explained in chapter 8).</li>
	<li>d.	 You may need to introduce the concept of different classes of service</li>
	<li>for work requests (explained in chapter 11).</li>
	<li>e.	 Agree on a lead-time target for each class of service of work items.</li>
	<li>This is known as a service-level agreement (<span class="caps">SLA</span>), and is explained in</li>
	<li>chapter 11.<br />
8. Create a board/card wall to track the value stream you are controlling</li>
	<li>(explained in chapters 6 and 7).<br />
9. Optionally, create an electronic system to track and report the same</li>
	<li>(explained in chapters 6 and 7).<br />
10.Agree with the team to have a standup meeting every day in front of the</li>
	<li>board; invite up- and downstream stakeholders but don’t mandate their</li>
	<li>involvement (explained in chapter 7).<br />
11. Agree to have a regular operations review meeting for retrospective analy-</li>
	<li>sis of the process; invite up- and downstream stakeholders but don’t man-</li>
	<li>date their involvement (explained in chapter 14).<br />
12. Educate the team on the new board, <span class="caps">WIP</span> limits, and the pull system.</li>
	<li>Nothing else in their world should have changed. Job descriptions are</li>
	<li>the same. Activities are the same. Handoffs are the same. Artifacts are the</li>
	<li>same. Their process hasn’t changed, other than your asking them to accept</li>
	<li>a <span class="caps">WIP</span> limit and to pull work based on class-of-service policy rather than</li>
	<li>receiving it in a push fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">WIP</span> limits<br />
- prevent multi-tasking</p>
<p>rules for that game must be agreed upon by consensus among all the stakeholders.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’d love to accept this new work, as we realize it is very important to<br />
you. Equally, you know and understand that we have an agreed-upon <span class="caps">WIP</span> limit.<br />
You were part of that decision, and you understand why we made it. We want to<br />
be able to process requests reliably and in a timely manner. In order to take on your<br />
request, we will need to put something else aside. Which one of the current items in<br />
progress would you prefer that we drop in order to start your new item?”</p>
<p>Prioritization<br />
- aka queue replenishment<br />
- slots available<br />
- drop current work</p>
<p>Lead Time and Classes of Service</p>
<p>Recipe for success:<br />
1. learn to build high-quality code<br />
2. reduce the work-in-progress<br />
3. shorten lead times, and release often. <br />
4. balance demand against throughput, limit work-in-progress, and create slack to free<br />
up bandwidth, which will enable improvements.</p>
<p>Then, with a smoothly functioning and optimizing software development capability,<br />
improve prioritization to optimize value delivery.</p>
<p>Reduce variablity to improve predictabilty<br />
- reduce batch sizes<br />
- even out the arrival of work</p>
<p>== ch 4 <span class="caps">XIT</span> case study</p>
<p>neither the <span class="caps">PSP</span>/<span class="caps">TSP</span> method nor the <span class="caps">CMMI</span> rating of the<br />
vendor were likely to be the root cause of their problems. In fact, the team produced<br />
pretty much what was asked of them, and with very high quality</p>
<p>Visualise the work flow<br />
- Requests were arriving uncontrollably.</p>
<p>More than 90 percent of the lead time was queuing, or other forms of waste.</p>
<p>estimation effort alone was consuming around 33 percent of<br />
capacity, and on a bad month it could be as much as 40 percent.</p>
<p>No estimation<br />
Limit <span class="caps">WIP</span> to 1 request per developer</p>
<p>Establishing an Input Cadence<br />
weekly meeting “Which three items from the backlog would you most like delivered next?”</p>
<p>offer a “guaranteed” delivery time of 25 days from acceptance into<br />
the input queue. This 25 days was considerably greater than the 11 days of aver-<br />
age engineering time required to complete the job.</p>
<p>customers were being asked to give up <span class="caps">ROI</span> calculations and inter-department<br />
budget transfers based on estimated effort per request. In exchange, they were being<br />
offered unprecedented short delivery times and reliability.</p>
<p>To get around the accounting issues, they were asked to accept that all requests <br />
took, on average, 11 days of engineering. They were asked to accept that costs <br />
were essentially fixed.</p>
<p>guaranteed that each of the product managers would get a fair allocation of capacity</p>
<p>A simple, weighted round-robin scheme<br />
Or dedicate an amount of time per release</p>
<p>Any item older than six months was purged from backlog.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ROI</span> not needed: If something was important and valuable, it was selected for the <br />
input queue from the backlog; if it wasn’t, then it wasn’t selected.</p>
<p>team reduced the lead time to an average of 14 days against an 11-day engineering time</p>
<p>== ch 6 Mapping the value stream</p>
<p>Define work item types (bug, feature, refactoring, infrastructure)</p>
<p>Card wall (new, open, hold, resolved)</p>
<p>Demand Analysis<br />
If you have historical data, use it to make a quantitative study. If you do not,<br />
then an anecdotally derived subjective analysis will suffice.</p>
<p>Allocate work items based on demand analysis<br />
eg 60% feature, 10% Maintainance, 30% UI change</p>
<p>== ch 7 Coordination</p>
<p>Daily Standup Meetings<br />
- focus on flow of work (rather than 3 questions)<br />
- impediments / blockers / hold</p>
<p>Release planning</p>
<p>- Which items in the system are (or will be) ready for release?<br />
- What is required to actually release each item to production?<br />
- What testing will be required post-release to validate the integrity of produc-<br />
tion systems?<br />
- What risks are involved?<br />
- How are these risks being mitigated?<br />
- What contingency plans are required?<br />
- Who needs to be involved in the release and present during the push to produc-<br />
tion (or other delivery mechanism)?<br />
- How long will the release take?<br />
- What other logistics will be involved?</p>
<p>Triage: assessing and classifying into categories for priority of attention</p>
<p>Issue Log Review and Escalation</p>
<p>When work items in the Kanban system are impeded, they will be marked as such<br />
and an issue work item will be created. The issue will remain open until the imped-<br />
iment is removed and the original work item can progress through the system.</p>
<p>Reviewing open issues, therefore, becomes vital to improving flow through the<br />
system.</p>
<p>Issue-log review should happen frequently and regularly.</p>
<p>Create a &#8216;blocked&#8217; ticket state, or just use &#8216;hold&#8217; ?</p>
<p>When the telecommuter completed an item and changed its electronic status, they<br />
would contact their sticky buddy by instant message, email, or phone and ask them <br />
to update the physical board.</p>
<p>Synchronizing across Geographic Locations<br />
- electronic system<br />
- keep physical card walls synchronized, at the very least, on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Holding regular meetings reduces the coordination cost</p>
<p>Prioritization and release planning should be done independently and<br />
should have independent cadence.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Daily standup meetings should be used to discuss issues, impediments and flow</li>
</ul>
<p>Grooming the backlog with regular triage to reduce its size improves<br />
the effectiveness and efficiency of prioritization meetings.</p>
<p>Issue management, escalation, and resolution is a core discipline in improving <br />
performance</p>
<p>Escalation paths and policies should be clearly defined.</p>
<p>== ch 8 Delivery cadence</p>
<p>Kanban dispenses with the time-boxed iteration and instead decouples the ac-<br />
tivities of prioritization, development, and delivery.</p>
<p>Kanban also decouples the prioritization cadence from both the lead time through<br />
the system and from the delivery cadence.</p>
<p>Coordination Costs of Delivery<br />
- how much does it cost to deploy?</p>
<ul>
	<li>cost-only model. We must consider the total costs incurred between</li>
	<li>releases. Often this is a known amount—the burn rate of the organization. If we</li>
	<li>release once per month and our burn rate is $1.3 million per month, our costs are</li>
	<li>at least $1.3 million per release</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>MS burn rate £30k per month</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Delivery Efficiency% = 100% x (Total Cost – (Coordination Cost + Transaction Cost) ) / Total Cost of Software Release</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>100 * ( 30000 &#8211; ) / 30000</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>reducing of waste by reducing coordination and transaction costs in order to</li>
	<li>make the batch size efficient—in this case, to make the time between releases</li>
	<li>efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; In our case is the best option is to deploy every 2 weeks?</p>
<p>== Chapter 9  ❖  Establishing an Input Cadence</p>
<p>“Prioritization cadence” means an agreed-upon regular interval between<br />
meetings to prioritize new work into the input queue for development.</p>
<p>Prioritization of new work requests such as user stories involves coordi-<br />
nation of many people from various functions. All of this coordination<br />
has a measurable cost.</p>
<p>Estimation to facilitate prioritization decisions represents the transac-<br />
tion costs in both time and money associated with prioritization. These<br />
costs can be determined and tracked.</p>
<p>Prioritization cadence can be established by encouraging those involved<br />
in prioritization decision making to meet as regularly as is reasonable<br />
based on the transaction and coordination costs involved.<br />
Efficiency and cadence of prioritization can be increased by focusing<br />
on reducing its transaction and coordination costs.<br />
Frequent prioritization meetings build trust.<br />
Scheduling regular prioritization meetings reduces coordination costs<br />
and is particularly useful in lower-maturity organizations</p>
<p>== ch 10 <span class="caps">WIP</span> limits</p>
<p>Get buy in from all stakeholders</p>
<p>the tension created by imposing a <span class="caps">WIP</span> limit across<br />
the value-stream is positive tension. This positive tension forces discussion about<br />
the organization’s issues and dysfunctions. The dysfunctions generate impediments<br />
to flow and result in sub-optimal productivity, lead time, and quality. The discus-<br />
sion and collaboration invoked by the positive tension of a <span class="caps">WIP</span> limit is healthy. It<br />
is the mechanism that enables the emergence of a continuous-improvement culture.<br />
Without <span class="caps">WIP</span> limits, progress on process improvement is slow.</p>
<p>Capacity allocation allows us to guarantee service for each type of work received<br />
by the kanban system. The allocation should generally be made in response to the<br />
comparative demand observed for each type of work. Hence, it is important to<br />
complete some demand analysis to facilitate reasonable allocation of <span class="caps">WIP</span> limits on<br />
swim lanes for each type of work.</p>
<p>== Chapter 11  ❖  Establishing Service Level Agreements</p>
<p>Customers who pay more or who spend money with the airline on a regular<br />
basis enjoy a better class of service.</p>
<p>High severity, high priority defects<br />
are fixed immediately. They receive a different, higher, class of ser-<br />
vice than other work. To fix a high-severity production defect, we<br />
put other work aside, pull in as many people as we require</p>
<p>Classes of service provide us a convenient way of classifying work to provide ac-<br />
ceptable levels of customer satisfaction at an economically optimal cost. By quickly<br />
identifying the class of service for an item, we are spared the need to make a detailed<br />
estimate or analysis.</p>
<p>The Expedite (or “Silver Bullet”) <br />
- <span class="caps">ASAP</span><br />
1- Manufacturing companies often create policy to limit the number of expedite re-<br />
quests that hit a factory.</p>
<p>Fixed date</p>
<p>Standard</p>
<p>Intangaible (eg devliverable dates far in the future, refactoring)</p>
<p>offering a target lead time coupled with a due-date performance metric is an <br />
alternative to treating each item individually and having to estimate and commit <br />
to a delivery date for each item.</p>
<p>The service-level agreement allows us to avoid costly activities, such as<br />
estimation; low-trust activities, such as making commitments; and to spread risk by<br />
aggregating a large collection of requests and promising only aggregate performance<br />
in the form of a percentage due-date performance.</p>
<p>important to communicate that the target lead time in the<br />
Standard class of service is just that, a target!</p>
<p>The Expedite and Fixed Delivery Date classes of service were ensuring that im-<br />
portant items were always on time.</p>
<p>Due Date Performance (percentage) should be monitored for target lead times.</p>
<p>If classes of service are used properly and combined with a regular deliv-<br />
ery cadence, very few complaints are likely to be received, even if a sig-<br />
nificant portion of items miss their target lead time.</p>
<p>== ch 12 Metrics</p>
<p><span class="caps">WIP</span> (cumulative flow, or use board)</p>
<p>Lead time<br />
- against each class of service</p>
<p>Due Date Performance<br />
- for fixed date items</p>
<p>Throughput<br />
- number of items—delivered in a given time period, such as one month.<br />
- should increase<br />
- indicator of how well the system is performing, demonstrate continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Issues and Blocked Work Items<br />
cumulative-flow diagram of<br />
reported impediments overlaid with a graph of the number of work-in-progress<br />
items that have become blocked,</p>
<p>Flow Efficiency<br />
- lead time vs. time spent actually working on work item<br />
- not particularly useful day to day</p>
<p>Initial Quality<br />
- number of escaped defects as a percentage against the total <span class="caps">WIP</span> and throughput<br />
- bugs per feature</p>
<p>Failure Load, how many work items:<br />
- we process because of earlier poor quality—<br />
- are production defects / new features to overcome to mitigate existing shortcoming <br />
- causes inclucde poor usability or a failure to anticipate user needs properly.<br />
- shows capacity left on the table that could be used for new, value-added features.</p>
<p>== ch 14, Operations review</p>
<p>Objective, data-driven retrospective on the organization’s performance. Sets an<br />
expectation of objective, data-driven, quantitative management</p>
<p>Should be performed monthly. Can it be held in 1 hour?</p>
<p>Need to prepare data. Can the charts be generated automatically?</p>
<p>== ch 18 economic model</p>
<p>Waste can be classified into three main abstract categories: transaction<br />
costs, coordination costs, and failure load.</p>
<p>To determine if an activity is truly wasteful ask, “Would we do more of<br />
this if we could?” If the answer is no, then the activity is some form of<br />
waste.</p>
<p>Transaction costs come in two types: setup activities and cleanup, or delivery activities.</p>
<p>Coordination costs are activities that are performed in order to assign<br />
people to tasks, schedule events, or coordinate the work of two or more<br />
people toward a common outcome.</p>
<p>Failure load</p>
<ul>
	<li>is new value-added work that is generated because of some</li>
	<li>earlier failing, such as a defect in the software, or a poor design or imple-</li>
	<li>mentation that led to lack of customer adoption, a failure to realize a</li>
	<li>target payoff function, or a significant rise in help desk calls or service</li>
	<li>requests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>uses capacity that could be used for new, innovative, additional customer-valued, and revenue-generating features.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>demand generated by the customer that might have been avoided through higher quality delivered earlier.</li>
</ul>
