      <h1>Customer development at CareerMee</h1>

<div class='content'>                                 
   <p>This article is a business retrospective of my time at Careermee. After leaving the company I discovered Steve Blank&#8217;s Customer development process and he eerily described all of the mistakes we made &#8230;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>While I was working at (recently acquired by Nokia) Plazes, I received an offer to join <span class="caps">MBA</span> recruitment startup <a href="http://careermee.com/">Careermee</a> in August 2008 and move to Barcelona.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Auturm 2008 was probably the worst time in history to start an executive recruitement company. The recession really got going in early 2009 and most Fortune 500 companys had a hiring freeze in place.</p>
<p>So, I joined the Matt , Florian, Benny &amp; Steve in Calle Ferran, Barcelona (one of the busier streets just off the Plaza Nueva).</p>
<h2>What is Customer development ?</h2>
<p>Customer development focuses on <strong>understanding customer problems</strong> and needs from day one. The idea is to list all your hypothosses about your business model, customers etc. and test them in the field.</p>
<p>The process has four distinct phases (as seen below). An early stage company need only concern itself with phases 1 &amp; 2, culminating selling your product to a handful of early evangelist customers &amp; building a repeatable sales process.</p>
<p><img src="http://jussilaakkonen.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/customer-development-overview.png?w=450&amp;h=283" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Customer discovery</h2>
<p>The goal of the customer discovery phase is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;finding out who the customers for your product are and whether the problem you believe you are solving is important to them&#8221; <sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After 6 months of hardcore development, we didn&#8217;t even get this far. We were working in a vacuum with no feedback from potential customers. What we should have been doing was:</p>
<ol>
	<li>identifying the market type (new, niche, low cost etc.)</li>
	<li>list all hypothoses regarding customers, market size, pricing etc.</li>
	<li>calling 50 most promising companies from the Fortune 500</li>
	<li>getting meetings (online, phone or face to face) to <span class="caps">TEST</span> all hypothoses listed in step 2</li>
	<li>sharing information gathered with the whole team</li>
</ol>
<p>And do all of the above <span class="caps">BEFORE</span> <span class="caps">ANY</span> <span class="caps">CODE</span> IS <span class="caps">WRITTEN</span>!</p>
<h2>Customer validation</h2>
<p>Once you have established that there <em>may</em> be a market and you have a <strong>list of potential customers</strong>, move on to customer validation; where the goal is to build a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;repeatable sales process that has been field-tested by successfully selling the product to early customers&#8221; <sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said earlier, we didn&#8217;t even get to customer discovery at Careermee. We had an idea of our target market (Fortune 500 companies) but no clue why they would choose us over a headhunder or their existing HR tools and processes. We were operating on a build it and how could they possiby refuse such a cool service.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t bother with customer creation or company building. We should have been so lucky to get that far. Here&#8217;s a few lessons learned from the crater we left:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An early stage business is <span class="caps">NOT</span> an existing company in miniature. We had a 4 people in our sales department and no ideas who our customers were.</li>
	<li>Instead, focus on continous contact with potential customers from day one.</li>
	<li>Share your company cash flow with the whole team. Nothing will help you prioritise your feature list better than customer feedback, good estimates and cash flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should add that this is all hindsight on my part. I found out about customer development <em>after</em> I left the company.</p>
