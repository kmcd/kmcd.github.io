      <h1>Email productivity with Inbox Zero and ThunderBird</h1>

   <h2>Start with a clean slate</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Triage: move all mail to an archive folder</li>
	<li>Turn off notifications</li>
	<li>View unread email only</li>
	<li>Hide the side bar</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s my inbox &#8230;</p>
<p><img src="inbox.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>How to process your email</h2>
<p>This is the easy part! When your check your new email, all you have to do is <strong>delete OR reply immediately</strong>. Learn to love those keys (delete &amp; <span class="caps">CTRL</span> + R). See the next section for how to reply efficently.</p>
<p>I only keep reciepts, airline tickets etc. Everything else is deleted. If you absolutely must keep hold of an email &#8212; just archive it. You must keep your inbox lean &amp; clean.</p>
<p>Very occasionally, I&#8217;ll tag an email as todo or important. They usually sit in my inbox for a few days until I reply.</p>
<p>If you find yourself getting unwanted mail, either unsubscribe or set up a mail filter to delete it.</p>
<h2>Replying &amp; composing messages</h2>
<p>Press <strong><span class="caps">CTRL</span> + R to reply then delete the message</strong> from your inbox. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll have the message in your reply anyway.</p>
<p>Your email messages should be <strong>no more than five paragraphs</strong>. Each paragraph should have one clear point only. Even still, I find it takes me time to write a concise, clear message.</p>
<p>If you find yourself typing the same text over again, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/quicktext">install the quick text plugin</a>. It&#8217;ll save you lots of keystrokes. You can even set up hot keys for each text snippet. I use it for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>boiler plate text like Hi {name}, Regards, Keith.</li>
	<li>replying to job applications</li>
	<li>sending invoices</li>
</ul>
<h2>The key to not getting sidetracked by your inbox is to de-couple sending and reading. You should <span class="caps">NOT</span> open your inbox to send a message.</h2>
<h2>You can open a new email thusly: thunderbird -compose.</h2>
<p>Here are some appliication lauchers to put new email at your finger tips:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Operating System </th>
		<th>Hot key </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> gnome </td>
		<td> alt + F2 </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> windows </td>
		<td> windows key + R </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> os X </td>
		<td> alt + space </td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re working away on something and you need to shoot off an email, just fire up your app launcher, type thunderbird -compose and then get back to work.</p>
<p>Lastly, only send essential emails. You know that opinion someone asked or that funny link on youtube &#8211; just hit delete. It&#8217;s not important &#8230; really it&#8217;s not. If you send less messages, you&#8217;ll receive less mail.</p>
<h2>Decide when to check your email</h2>
<p>Lastly, the really hard part. This, like quitting an addiction will take time, patience and many attempts. You <span class="caps">WILL</span> find yourself sneakily checking for new mail. Just try and pick times that work for you and stick with it.</p>
<p>Choose when to check your messages. <strong>I check mine at 11:00 &amp; 15:00</strong>, Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>You might need to let people know that you&#8217;ll only be chekcing your mail periodically. You can create an auto-responder or add a signature to your email stating when you intend to check your mail.</p>
<p>If possible <strong>don&#8217;t check first thing in the morning</strong>. If you absolutely must, just open &amp; scan for emergencies or something that can&#8217;t wait until your first scheduled check.</p>
