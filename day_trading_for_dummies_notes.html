   <p>= Questions</p>
<p>Stocks generally trade in blocks of 100. Does this mean to avoid having more than<br />
5% of your a/c in play you can only buy stocks below a certain level? eg</p>
<ul>
	<li>a/c               5,000</li>
	<li>5% trade limit    250</li>
	<li>max stock price   2.5</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>You can buy stocks in blocks of less than 100, however xtn costs may be</li>
	<li>prohibitive</li>
	<li>Is the bid-ask spread cleanly explained?</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>How long to achieve statistical significance with xtesting?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Not covered</li>
	<li>= Action points</li>
</ul>
<p>Use xtesting to calculate the win/loss probability</p>

</ul>
<p>= Notes</p>
<p>Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset in large quantity without affect-<br />
ing the price levels.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Volume is the total amount of a security that trades in a given time period. The</li>
	<li>greater the volume, the more buyers and sellers are interested in the security,</li>
	<li>and the easier it is to get in there and buy and sell without affecting the price.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Another measure of liquidity is frequency, or how often a security trades.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>The more frequently a security trades, the more opportunities you&#8217;ll have to</li>
	<li>identify the short-term profit opportunities that make day trading possible.</li>
	<li>The volatility of a security is how much the price varies over a period of time.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>standard deviation</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility, the higher the</li>
	<li>volatility, the more a security&#8217;s price is going to fluctuate, and the more profit —</li>
	<li>and loss — opportunities there are for a day trader.</li>
	<li>Stocks generally trade in round<br />
lots, which are orders of at least 100 shares. If you want to buy a stock worth<br />
$40 per share, you need $4,000 in your account.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>No one will stop you from buying a smaller amount than the usual round lot</li>
	<li>in any given security, but you&#8217;ll probably pay a high commission and get</li>
	<li>worse execution for your order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluating performance</p>
<p>In backtesting, a trader specifies the strategy that he or she would use and<br />
then runs it through a database of historic securities prices to see whether<br />
the strategy would have made money. The test includes assumptions about<br />
commissions, leverage, and position size.</p>
<p>Start with a hypothesis</p>
<p>Past performance is not indicative of future results. A strategy may test per-<br />
fectly, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will continue to work. Backtesting is an impor-<br />
tant step to successful day trading, but it is only one step.</p>
<p>Paper trading does not take into a/c the effect of the placing your trade</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to do good simulation for months than to lose thousands of real</p>
<ul>
	<li>dollars in hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Profit &amp; Loss statement (what time frame &#8211; daily, weekly?)</p>
<p>Technical analysis</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis can actually hurt you in day trading, because you may<br />
start making decisions for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>A pivot point is the average of the high, low, and close price for the day. If the<br />
next day&#8217;s price closes above the pivot point, that sets a new support level,<br />
and if the next day&#8217;s price is below the pivot point, that sets a new resistance<br />
level.</p>
<p>moving average. It&#8217;s calculated by averaging the closing prices for a given<br />
time period</p>
<ul>
	<li>whats your time period?</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>A crossover occurs whenever the price crosses the moving</li>
	<li>average line. Usually, it&#8217;s a good idea to buy when the price crosses above the</li>
	<li>moving average line and to sell when the price crosses below it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>To use convergence and divergence in analysis, the trader looks at moving</li>
	<li>averages from different time periods, such as 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>When two or three of the moving average lines converge (come together),</li>
	<li>that means that the trend may be ending. That often makes it a good time to</li>
	<li>buy if the trend has been down — and a good time to sell if the trend has</li>
	<li>been up. If two or three of the moving average lines split up and diverge, that</li>
	<li>means that the trend is likely to continue. That means that it&#8217;s probably a</li>
	<li>good time to buy if the trend is up and sell if the trend is down.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A moving average is a lagging indicator. It sums up trading activity in the last</li>
	<li>5, 10, 30, or 60 days.</li>
	<li>Phases of a trend</li>
	<li>Accumulation: This is the first part of the trend, where traders get</li>
	<li>excited about a security and its prospects. They start new positions or</li>
	<li>add to existing ones.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>ߜ Main phase (also called continuation): Here, the trend moves along</li>
	<li>nicely, with no unusual price action. The highs get higher on an uptrend,</li>
	<li>and the lows get lower on a downtrend. A trader might make money, but</li>
	<li>not big money, following the trend here.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>ߜ Consolidation (also called congestion): This is a sideways market. The</li>
	<li>security stays within the trend, but without hitting higher highs or lower</li>
	<li>lows. It just stays within the trading range. A consolidation phase is</li>
	<li>good for scalpers, who make a large volume of trades in search of very</li>
	<li>small profits. It can be boring for everyone else.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>ߜ Retracement (also called correction or pullback): This is a secondary</li>
	<li>trend, a short-term pullback away from the main trend to the support</li>
	<li>level. Retracements create buying opportunities, but they can also kill</li>
	<li>day traders who are following the trend.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>ߜ Distribution: In the distribution phase, traders don&#8217;t think that the</li>
	<li>security can go up in price any more. Hence, they tend to sell in large</li>
	<li>volume.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>ߜ Reversal: This is the point where the trend changes. It&#8217;s time to sell if</li>
	<li>you had been following an uptrend and buy if you had been following a</li>
	<li>downtrend. Many reversals follow classic patterns, which are discussed</li>
	<li>later in this chapter.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Momentum</li>
	<li>If the rate of change on the trend is going up, then rising prices are likely to occur.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>To calculate momentum, take today&#8217;s closing price for a security, divide that</li>
	<li>by the closing price ten days ago, and then multiply by 100.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>&gt; What are other momentum calculations?</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Momentum is a leading technical indicator. It tells you what is likely to</li>
	<li>happen in the future, not what has happened in the past.</li>
	<li>&gt; Proof?</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>A breakout occurs when a security price passes through and stays above —</li>
	<li>or below — the resistance or support line, which creates a new trend with</li>
	<li>new support and resistance levels.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>A one-time breakout may just be an anomaly, what technicians sometimes call a false breakout</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The exact amount of momentum that a security has can be measured with</li>
	<li>indicators known as momentum oscillators.</li>
	<li>A classic momentum oscillator</li>
	<li>starts with the moving average of closing prices for a past time period</li>
	<li>day&#8217;s moving average is plotted below the price line</li>
	<li>when positive, traders say that the security is overbought;</li>
	<li>when it is negative, they say that the security is oversold</li>
</ul>
<p>A tick is an upward or downward price change</p>
<p>arbitrage comes from the French word for judgment</p>
<ul>
	<li>suitable for automation because it requires fast work</li>
	<li>You sell as much</li>
	<li>of the high-priced asset in the high-priced market as you can, borrowing shares</li>
	<li>if you need to, and then you immediately turn around and buy the low-priced</li>
	<li>asset in the low-priced market.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>&#8594; dont do it: too complex!</li>
	<li>Scalping</li>
	<li>especially active in the commodity markets</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>scalpers look to take advantage of changes in a security&#8217;s bid-ask spread.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>difference between the price that a broker will buy a security for from those</li>
	<li>who want to sell it (the bid) and the price that the broker will charge to</li>
	<li>purchase (ask)</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>If the spread between the bid and the ask is wider than usual, then the</li>
	<li>ask is higher and the bid is lower than it should be. That&#8217;s because</li>
	<li>slightly more people want to buy than sell, so the brokers charge the</li>
	<li>buyers higher prices. The scalper uses this as a sign to sell.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>if the spread between the bid and the ask is narrower than usual, then</li>
	<li>the ask is lower and the bid is higher than it would normally be</li>
	<li>That happens if there are slightly more sellers than buyers, and the broker</li>
	<li>wants to find buyers to pick up the slack.</li>
	<li>The scalper would be in there buying and hoping that the selling pressure is short lived.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You&#8217;ll need a low trade cost structure</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>He also has to be sure that the price changes</li>
	<li>aren&#8217;t driven by real information, because that will make market prices too</li>
	<li>volatile to make scalping profitable. Scalping is “picking up nickels in front of</li>
	<li>a steamroller,” some traders say, because of the risk of focusing on small</li>
	<li>price changes when bigger changes are underway.</li>
</ul>
