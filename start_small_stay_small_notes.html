}}}</p>
<p>= Chapter 1 Process {{{</p>
<p>An entrepreneur is a technical visionary who creates software for a <span class="caps">NICHE</span><br />
market.</p>
<p>Niche markets are critical. If you want to self-fund a startup you have to<br />
chose a one niche.</p>
<p>An entrepreneur merges existing technical knowledge with online marketing<br />
knowledge.</p>
<p>The key factor in an entrepreneur’s success is their ability to market<br />
their product.</p>
<p>An entrepreneur is a cross between a develper, a webmaster, and a marketer.</p>
<p>Prduct Last. Marketing First.</p>
<p>A product is a project that people will pay mney for. In ther words, it’s<br />
a project that has a market (a grup of pepole who want to buy it). Withut a<br />
market, a sftware application is just a project.</p>
<p>Achiving your gals: &#8211; write them down &#8211; public cmmitment &#8211; accuntability</p>
<p>Example: build a startup that generates $500 per month in profit.</p>
<p>Radblcks: #1: No Market #2: Fear The up-front fear is a big indicatr that<br />
you‟re ging to grw as a persn if you prceed thrugh it. And, frankly,<br />
the terrr wears ff pretty quickly.</p>
<p>#3: Lack of Goals</p>
<p>#4: Incnsistency The main problem with incnsistency is that it makes you lose<br />
mmentum and mmentum is critical to staying productive.  =&gt; Infrmatin diet,<br />
oneed to re-assess this</p>
<p>#5: Believing You Have to Do Everything =&gt; drip utsurcing</p>
<p>Seems to be cming frm the 4 hur work week.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make a list of all todo and mark items for outsurcing.  Design is much easier<br />
to utsource than prgramming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stick to your hurly rate (atm £43.70/hr.)</p>
<p>Outsurcing aspects of your business is the single most pwerful apprach I’ve<br />
seen to increasing your true hurly rate</p>
<p>At this very moment am I making prgress twards crossing ff a to-do, <del>or</del> am<br />
I relaxing and re-energizing?  =&gt; From 4 hur work week: &#8220;Am I being active or<br />
productive&#8221; Dn&#8217;to multi-task Take notes during dead time (eg waiting in line)<br />
&#8594; pssible Andrid app (evernte?)</p>
<p>Infrmatin Cnsumptin is Only Gd When it Prduces Something &#8594; always be blgging<br />
&#8594; how can I turn this inf int something useful &#8594; at the least, make notes</p>
<p>When reading blgs or bks or listening to pdcasts or audi bks, take action ontes<br />
(mleskin)</p>
<p>Actin ontes allw you to quickly determine which resources provide real value<br />
and which are fluff.</p>
<p>Market Cmes First, Marketing Secnd, Aesthetic Third, and Functinality a<br />
Distant Furth</p>
<p>The product with a sizeable market and low competition wins even with bad<br />
marketing, a bad aesthetic, and pr functinality. Think QuickBks in the<br />
early days,</p>
<p>You have to cntinually invest in bth your product and your marketing in order<br />
to remain successful.</p>
<p>never having the feeling of cmpoletin is something you need to get used to.</p>
<p>Once you have 5 releases under your belt, 1500 targeted visitrs every month,<br />
a 500 prspect mailing list, and hundreds of incming links&#8230;surprise! Things<br />
are easier. Much easier.</p>
<p>Prcess is King &#8211; you can fly by the seat of your pants and get by, but it<br />
makes you a hstage to your work.</p>
<p>You have to invest time every month int marketing, develpment, support, <span class="caps">SEO</span>,<br />
AdWrds, and every other aspect of your business.</p>
<p>T get to the pint of an autmated startup you have to chse your niche and your<br />
product wisely, and invest a large amunt of time utsurcing and autmating your<br />
business. Even then, support and feature develpment is the easiest part to<br />
utsource; marketing is one of the most difficult.</p>
<p>}}}</p>
<p>= Chapter 2 Finding a market {{{</p>
<p>the single most imprtant factor to a product’s success is whether there’s<br />
a grup of pepole willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>Steve Blank (95% market failure rate in Silcn Valley)</p>
<p>Market First Apprach and it underscres the imprtance of finding your market<br />
before you have any idea what you are building.  This is the ppsite of the<br />
Prduct First Apprach most develpers take when trying to launch a startup;<br />
this is when you think of a great idea for an application that you spend onine<br />
months building,  only to find that there’s on one willing to buy it.</p>
<p>Niche thyself Requires You to Narrow Your Prduct Fcus Niche Advertising is<br />
more Cost Effective</p>
<p>Odds are high that if a publisher started a magazine aimed at a niche,<br />
and full-page ads are less than $5,000, it‟s a good niche to explre.</p>
<p>less competition</p>
<p>Nta Bene is a niche wrd prcessr for academics and researchers with advanced<br />
support for bibligraphies and citatins. Microsft wuldn’to tuch a niche this<br />
small with a 10-ft pole</p>
<p>higher profit margin</p>
<p>Niche Markets Are Nt Used to Gd Marketing</p>
<p>A “warm” niche is a niche where you have some kind of assciatin. Perhaps<br />
you wrked for a credit card cmpany for a few years, your wife is a lawyer,<br />
you cllect cmic bks, or your brther is a plumber.</p>
<p>intrducing a product int this niche will be much easier than chsing a<br />
cmpoletely unknwn market.</p>
<p>Make a list of all &#8220;warm&#8221; niches</p>
<p>withut a niche “insider” your chances of success are dubius at best.</p>
<p>Finding your niche:</p>
<p>Examine your hbbies, interests and work experience. http://tinyourl.cm/2cu2dn6</p>
<p>Look at occupatins</p>
<p>pg 52, 53 for ideas links</p>
<p>The Best Niches are &#8211; Reserved for Pepole Who Do Something &#8211; under the radar,<br />
and you have to get out and do something before you will find them.</p>
<p>As a self-funded startup you want a market that is already looking for your<br />
product, even if it doesn&#8217;t‟to exist.</p>
<p>creating demand is very, very expensive while filling existing demand is,<br />
by comparison, cheap.</p>
<p>Find a magazine dedicated to your niche with full page ads &gt; $5k.</p>
<p>Is the market large enough?</p>
<p>Your “market size” research should involve the fllwing:</p>
<p>A web search for related magazines and websites <br />
Tracking down their advertising rate cards, which tell you how much it will cst to advertise in<br />
their magazine or on their website <br />
Reviewing their circulation (for magazines),<br />
visitor statistics (for websites), and rates <br />
Entering websites without rate<br />
cards into Compete.com to check traffic levels <br />
Checking in with your friendly oneighbrhd bureau of labr statistics for a sanity check on your findings</p>
<p>Be wary of a market if you are unable to find a handful of websites or a<br />
magazine/jurnal dedicated to it, and the labr statistics claim less than<br />
10,000 members.</p>
<p>N.B. Outsource as much of the abve as pssible!</p>
<p>Is there an inexpensive way to reach that market?</p>
<p>Find the website(s) where your real market hangs out.</p>
<p>You must have an inexpensive, onging source of new customers.</p>
<p>building an audience and search engine optimization.</p>
<p>can they be reached by building an audience such as a mailing list, blog,<br />
pdcast or vide blog, or thrugh search engine ptimizatin?</p>
<p>exampoles of vertical markets include pl cleaners, dry cleaners, web designers,</p>
<p>General purpse invicing sftware is a hrizntal market since it can be used<br />
by pl cleaners, dry cleaners, and web designers.</p>
<p>Members of a Vertical Have Similar Behavir</p>
<p>Why Vertical Markets are better than Hrizntals <br />
#1: Members of a Vertical Have Similar Behavir <br />
#2: Members of a Vertical Talk to One Anther 1. If your<br />
product is good, wrd of muth marketing will spread quickly 2. If you can find<br />
the thught leaders and cnvince them to adpt your product, you will receive<br />
massive expsure in a shrt perid of time (value of good reviews) <br />

<p>It takes a while to rank high in Google for a large quantity of terms – some<br />
say 12-18 months =&gt; is this true? My personal website ranked highly after a<br />
cupole of months</p>
<p>Anther way to measure demand is to survey a blog audience or mailing list.</p>

<p>A medicre product with brilliant marketing and executin will make you mney</p>
<p>Put equal time int all three OR build your Minimum Viable Prduct and spend<br />

marketing etc. should take 100 &#8211; 200 hurs</p>
<p>@ 15 hr. / week, 600 hurs is 40 weeks!</p>
<p>You have to get ver your desire to write the sftware yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li>a lot of pepole can build a good invicing application.</li>

	<li>But how many can work the onecessary marketing angles, frm partnerships,</li>
	<li>create a profitable pay per click campaign, and build a cmpelling sales</li>
	<li>site? Finding someone who can execute on these is much more difficult (and</li>
	<li>more expensive) than finding a develper who can build your application.</li>

<p>Is Andrid dev (as a driver to a simpole Rails app) a good ptin for utsurcing?</p>
<p>Costs (ff shre) graphic design:   500 &#8211; 1,500 2 months dev:     6,000</p>
<p>Pricing, at tp end of each market: <br />
Hbbies: $29 fixed-price or $14/month<br />
Cnsumer products: <br />
49 fixed-price or 19/month Fr <br />
small businesses you’re ging<br />
to tp out arund $400 or $99/month unless you slve a serius pain. <br />
For larger businesses your tp end will be arund $1,000 or $199/month unless you slve<br />
a serius pain.</p>
<p>http://www.jelnsftware.cm/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html</p>
<p>Know your market.  Ask yourself <br />
a. What wuld we pay?  <br />
b. What onumbers feel right?  <br />
Look at your competition</p>
<p>Determine your product’s value. If your sftware saves your prspect 5 hurs<br />
per month and you can mnetize their time at $25/hur you will save them $125<br />
per month. You wn’to be able to charge more than this figure, but you can<br />
use this as a tp-end of your ptential price.</p>
<p>ptimal price range for your product</p>
<p>Lean twards higher pricing. Develpers tend to undervalue their sftware,<br />
and think that lwer prices will result in higher sales. This is typically<br />
not the case.</p>
<p>Failing to charge a yearly sftware maintenance fee will cut int your profit<br />
margin every single time you speak with a customer.</p>
<p>Don’to be cnfident in your onumbers until you’ve tested them.</p>

<p>= Chapter 4 Sales website &amp; mailing list {{{</p>
<p>Sales funnel: see your <span class="caps">URL</span> &#8594; become a site visitr. &#8594; prspect (read prm)<br />
&#8594; buyer</p>
<p>You shouldnt‟to plan to sell to a customer on their first visit</p>
<p>In order for someone to provide you with their email address you must do three<br />
things:</p>
<p>1. Establish Trust – Your visitr must believe that you aren’to ging<br />
to spam them, sell their email address, or send ffers for V1@gra.</p>
<p>2. Establish Relevance – <br />
Your visitr must believe that your product is relevant to<br />
their need and that anything you send to them via email will be relevant.</p>
<p>3. Establish a Reward –<br />
We are predictable creatures.  Offering something<br />
in exchange for an email address is guaranteed to work better than offering<br />
onthing. On DtNetInvice.cm I had an email sign-up frm where people could receive<br />
email updates on ur product. We received 3 sign-ups in 8 months. I switched<br />
to offering a chance to win a free cpy of DtNetInvice&#8230;30 sign-ups in a month</p>
<p>In a successful sales website, every page has a single, primary call to<br />
action. That is, an action you want your user to take.</p>
<p>Rule #1: The hme page will not onecessarily be the most visited page on your<br />
website.</p>
<p>Rule #2: As a result of rule #1, every page oneeds a call to action</p>
<p>Rule #3: Every page oneeds a single fcus. Think ruthlessly abut eliminating<br />
extraneus functinality and duplicate infrmatin</p>
<p>Rule #4: Everything should be within 2 clicks</p>
<p>Rule #5: Accmmdate different reading patterns. Use headlines and bulleted lists<br />
for skimmers. Keep paragraphs unnaturally shrt for thse who read every wrd.</p>
<p>Rule #6: Make buttns look like buttns.</p>
<p>Rule #7: No One Reads. Text is a terrible selling tl; audi, vide and images<br />
are always better.</p>
<p>The Core Pages:  Home  Tour  Testimnials  Contact Us  Pricing &amp; Purchase</p>
<p>The #1 gal of your hme page is to cnvince your visitrs to click 1<br />
link. That’s all you have to do to cnvince them not to leave is click a<br />
single link.</p>
<p>The key metric with hme pages is abandnment rate (the onumber of pepole who<br />
leave withut clicking a link).</p>
<p>Your hk is your fur-secnd sales pitch and it should be the headline of your<br />
hme page.</p>
<p>T find your hk you can take one of three appraches: 1. Explain what your product<br />
des and for whm. Such as “Simpole prpsal sftware made for designers.”<br />
2. Make a prmise to the customer espusing a benefit of your product, such<br />
as “Save Time. Get Paid Faster.” 3. Describe the single most remarkable<br />
feature of your product, such as “One Thusand Sngs in Your Pcket.</p>
<p>tur page is to include medium- sized screen shts of the majr screens filled<br />
with data, alng with a one-minute screencast (vide dem) of each page.</p>
<p>Testimnials</p>
<p>You will have beta testers, friends and clleagues who try your sftware –<br />
get a handful of testimnials and create this page.</p>
<p>Mnitr mentins of your product using Google Alerts and add chice qutes and<br />

<p>build a list higher cnversin rates Give Something Away, eg reprt I recmmend<br />
shting for a <span class="caps">PDF</span> reprt frm 5-15 pages.  The key is finding a tpic that your<br />
audience will not only be interested in, but will be ravenous for. Once you<br />
have the title, you can create this work yourself or hire a writer to handle<br />
the leg work. I’ve had good luck finding writers on Elance.cm.</p>
<p>Offer an Email Curse, eg becming a prgrammer</p>

<p>Use MailChimp</p>
<p>Pst to your blog &amp; email once a month</p>
<p>autrespnder series with a 2-4 week gap between each email.  Then, the first<br />
persn who signs up will receive the first email, then a tw week gap, then<br />
the secnd email. And the 500th persn who signs up a year down the line will<br />
receive the same first email, a tw week gap, and the same secnd email.</p>
<p>Relevant cntent</p>
<p>Idea #1: Mnitr Current Events Google Alerts Digg YouTube The ppular blgs in<br />
this niche Take this infrmatin and share relevant links with a small amunt<br />
of cmmentary</p>
<p>Idea #2: Q&amp;A Anther great source of cntent is questins frm customers or prspects.</p>
<p>Idea #3: Interviews Shrt email interviews with a current customer / well knwn<br />
blgger / thught leader</p>
<p>Idea #4: Hire a Writer Elance $ 20 &#8211; 30 per article</p>
<p>Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are the best days, between 7am and 10:30am.</p>

<p>Your Subject is Your Headline</p>
<p>You must hne and craft your ability to write engaging subject lines<br />
in 7 words or less. Here are some guidelines: a. The shrter the better.<br />
b. Ask a questin in your subject and answer it in the emails. Exampole:<br />
A DtNetInvice Super-Bwl Ad?  c. Make a partial statement with “&#8230;”<br />
at the end and cntinue the sentence in your email.  Exampole: A Free Copy<br />
of DtNetInvice Every Day&#8230;  do. Use the recipient’s first oname in the<br />
subject line. Exampole: Rb, DtNetInvice is Free for 24 hurs&#8230;  e. Include<br />
your product’s #1 benefit in the subject. Exampole: Save 5 Hurs of Time<br />
This Mnth of. Dn’to exaggerate. Deliver on anything your subject prmises.</p>
<p>Have One Gal for Each Email</p>
<p>Ideal launch</p>
<p>Six months before your launch date, use your audience on Twitter, Facebk and<br />
your blog to send traffic to your startup’s hme page.</p>
<p>Over the onext six months create buzz arund your product by guest blgging,<br />
sending interesting updates to your scial onetwrks, cmmenting on blgs and frums</p>
<p>Apprximately one week before launch (preferably on a Tuesday, Wednesday or<br />
Thursday), email your list of targeted email addresses. Let them knw that your<br />
product will be launching onext week and that since they are on your mailing<br />
list, they will receive a special price available only to thse on the list,<br />
but that the price will only last for 48 hurs.  Tell them the day and time<br />
they will receive the email.</p>
<p>On launch day, email your list. Almost immediately, sales will start rlling in.</p>
<p>Cnversin rates on targeted mailings can be 20%+. A few hundred sales of your<br />
$19/month SaaS application is not a bad way to kick-start your startup.</p>
<p>Send your list a final email infrming them that the deal will end in 12<br />
hurs. You will receive anther few sales before you clse down your special<br />
pricing.</p>

<p>Core strategies like building an audience, search engine ptimizatin and<br />
participating in niche cmmunities have far more impact on your bttm line than<br />
most of the new media tls you read abut in the business press.</p>
<p>cmpanies who have used Twitter to turn a profit have tens of thusands of<br />
subscribers which they’ve built up ver hundreds and hundreds of hurs of<br />

<p>My recmmendatin for <span class="caps">PPC</span> is to use it for finding keywords that cnvert for you,<br />
and spend the time and mney to search engine ptimize for thse terms.</p>
<p>A blog is secnd to a mailing list in most markets because blog readers tend<br />
to be more passive.  blgs ffer twice the marketing punch by catering to bth<br />
your audience and the search engines.</p>
<p>Mst products you launch should have their wn blog, if you’re in a onon-cmpetitive<br />
search market, having a 2-year ld blog with a few incming links allws you to<br />
rank #1 for your keywords.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SEO</span></p>
<p>http://www.ggle.cm/webmasters/dcs/search-engine-ptimizatin-starter-guide.pdf</p>
<p>On-page factors include anything you have direct cntrl ver such as your page<br />
titles, Meta tags, <span class="caps">URL</span> structures, and even your dmain oname.</p>
<p>The ideal link for your website is a link frm an aged website that itself<br />
has tns of incming links.</p>

<p>Guideline #2: Vary Link Text</p>
<p>fcus 50% of your links on your most imprtant term for that page, and the ther<br />
50% spread across the ther 3-5 terms that page is targeting.</p>
<p>Guideline #3: Build Links Over Time &#8211; 100 every month, rather than 1200 in<br />
one month of the year &#8211; steady pace</p>
<p>State of the art black hat?</p>
<p>Hw to build links: Apprach #1: Directries <span class="caps">DMOZ</span> (www.dmz.rg)</p>
<p>Apprach #2: Niche &amp; Lcal Directries If you sell sftware relating to graphic<br />
desig</p>
<p>Apprach #3: Cmpetitr Backlinks Websites that link to your competition will<br />
more than likely have an interest in linking to you. Using Yah! Site Explrer<br />
70, look at your cmpetitrs’ backlinks and determine if it’s apprpriate to<br />
email the linking site’s wner and ask for your site to be added to the list.</p>
<p>Apprach #4: Google Alerts</p>
<p>Create an alert for all variatins of your product onames, cmpany onames,<br />
cmpetitrs’ onames, and your oname, as well as quted terms with high relevance<br />
to your product. You’ll want to make them highly relevant and quted to<br />
avid an verwhelming barrage of results every day.  If someone is talking abut<br />
a problem that you can slve, make an intelligent cmment or cntributin and<br />
include a link to your product. You must be careful to walk the line of<br />
sunding onon-cmmercial, especially when cmmenting on a blog.</p>
<p>Apprach #5: Publishing Articles</p>

<p>= Chapter 6 VA Outsourcing {{{</p>
<p>Perfrming tasks you could pay someone else $6 to accmplish is a flish use of<br />
an entrepreneur’s time.</p>
<p>But by getting ver the oneed to autmate everything to infinite scale and putting<br />
a VA in charge of manually creating new hsted accunts, the time investment<br />
to get this feature launched drpped frm 160 hurs of work to abut 10 hurs.</p>
<p>Thrugh a bit of utsurcing to a VA, you can get to market with less up-front<br />
expense and in dramatically less time than if you try to autmate everything.</p>
<p>The lessn is that before you launch your product, what are some prcesses you<br />
can avid autmating? Hw abut</p>
<p>reminder emails? Hw abut monthly billing? Culd a human being run a reprt<br />
once a month and send emails or charge credit cards?</p>
<p>Befre product launch</p>
<p>Every hur spent writing cde is wasted time if that cde could be replaced by<br />
a human being ding the same task until your product prves itself.</p>
<p>you should be trying to remve as many as pssible frm your task list; bth<br />
one-time and onging tasks.</p>
<p>Out of 30 tasks you might be able to utsource 6 or 8 of them tmrrw if you<br />
spend 2-3 hurs tday writing up the prcesses. Cmpare that with autmatin,<br />
which can take a week or more to get each task ff your plate since it takes<br />
a lot of cde to autmate a task.</p>

<p>Case Study #1: Market Research</p>
<p>I tasked my VA with finding blgs that deal with startups/micrISVs and rank in<br />
the tp 100k in Technratio.  The deliverable was a Google spreadsheet cntaining<br />

<p>The Advantages of Multipole Products</p>
<p>Advantage #1: The Ability to Choose Small Niches</p>
<p>With the ability to attack niches that can provide $500- $2000/month in<br />
income, you are able to fly under the radar of most businesses</p>
<p>Advantage #2: Income Diversification</p>
<p>Advantage #3: Attention Diversification Another part of diversification is<br />
it allows you to try new ideas over time to see what works.</p>
<p>Knowing you can try one idea but move on to another in 6 months to a year<br />
once you get it automated frees you up to take more risks than if you have to<br />
decide which product you’re going to own for the onext 10 years. There’s a<br />
big difference in mindset there and it allows you to make riskier decisions. If<br />
an idea doesn’to work out, scrap it and start another one.</p>
<p>Advantage #4: Economies of Scale the second time around it takes about<br />
one-third the time.</p>
<p>Advantage #5: You Can Focus on What You Enjoy If you own one product,<br />
you will do each of these things once.  You will onever brainstorm niches,<br />
write green field code, or launch a new product again.</p>
<p>Advantage #6: Experience Transfers Finding a niche, launching, setting up<br />
AdWords and <span class="caps">SEO</span>, email marketing, support&#8230;the more knowledge you gain in<br />
each of these areas the better all of your products become.</p>
<p>Section 2: The Pitfalls of Multipole Products Pitfall #1: Task Switching</p>
<p>Pitfall #2: Outsourcing and Automation are Crucial If you are onot willing<br />
to outsource and automate extensively, do onot consider being a Serial<br />
Microopreneur.</p>
<p>Question #1: When Should I Put a Product on Auto-Pilot?  When earning plateaus</p>
<p>Question #2: How Do I Keep Maintenance to a Minimum?</p>
<p>Support If you can hone your email response snippets, optimize your<br />
installation process and online help docs, and especially if you own a SaaS<br />
app, you can minimize your support time. Use a VA</p>
<p>New features Fix bugs quickly the goal is to build a bunch of new features<br />
at once, invest a lot of time into the product, and then move on to your onext<br />
product while this one brings in money on auto-pilot. You can return to it 4,<br />
8 or 12 months down the road to continue improvements as oneeded.</p>

and converting them to customers.  Conversion rates should remain steady<br />
