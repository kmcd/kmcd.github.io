   <p>= Copywriting</p>
<p>delivering words (whether written or spoken) that get people to take some<br />
form of action.</p>
<p>== Headlines</p>
<p>Only 20% get past the headline</p>
<p>Write headline 1st <br />
List posts are successfull <br />
8 Words or Less</p>
<p>Direct Headlines go straight to the heart of the matter, without any attempt<br />
at cleverness. Bly gives the example of Pure Silk Blouses – 30 Percent<br />
Off as a headline that states the selling proposition directly. A direct<br />
blog post title might read Free <span class="caps">SEO</span> E-book.</p>
<p>An Indirect Headline takes a more subtle approach. It uses curiosity to<br />
raise a question in the reader’s mind, which the body copy answers. Often<br />
a double meaning is utilized, which is useful online.</p>
<p>The How to Headline is everywhere, online and off, for one reason only –<br />
it works like a charm.</p>
<p>A Question Headline must do more than simply ask a question, it must be a<br />
question that, according to Bly, the reader can empathize with or would like<br />
to see answered.</p>
<p>The Command Headline boldly tells the prospect what he needs to do, such<br />
as Exxon’s old Put a Tiger in Your Tank campaign. Bly indicates that the<br />
first word should be a strong verb demanding action, such as Subscribe to<br />
Copyblogger Today!</p>
<p>Another effective technique is called the Reason Why Headline. Your body<br />
text consists of a numbered list of product features or tips, which you then<br />
incorporate into the headline, such as Two Hundred Reasons Why Open Source<br />
Software Beats Microsoft. It’s not even necessary to include the words<br />
“reasons why.” This technique is actually the underlying strategy behind<br />
the ubiquitous blogger “list” posts, such as 8 Ways to Build Blog Traffic.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Testimonial Headline, which is highly effective because<br />
it presents outside proof that you offer great value. This entails taking<br />
what someone else has said about you, your product or service, and using<br />
their actual words in your headline. Quotation marks let the reader know that<br />
they are reading a testimonial, which will continue in the body copy. An<br />
example might be “I Read Copyblogger First Thing Each Morning,” admits<br />
Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p>Headlines, subheads and bullets should:</p>
<p>1. Be <span class="caps">USEFUL</span> to the reader, 2. Provide him with a sense of <span class="caps">URGENCY</span>, 3. Convey<br />
the idea that the main benefit is somehow <span class="caps">UNIQUE</span>; and 4. Do all of the above<br />
in an <span class="caps">ULTRA</span>-<span class="caps">SPECIFIC</span> way.</p>
<p>1. Does your headline offer the reader a reward for reading?  2. What specifics<br />
could you add to make your headline more intriguing and believable?  3. Does<br />
your headline trigger a strong, actionable emotion the reader already has<br />
about the subject at hand?  4. Does your headline present a proposition that<br />
will instantly get your prospect nodding his or her head?  5. Could your<br />
headline benefit from the inclusion of a proposed transaction?  6. Could<br />
you add an element of intrigue to drive the prospect into your opening copy?</p>
<p>== Body copy</p>
<p>First of all, focus on the reader – make an important promise early on (with<br />
your headline and opening paragraphs) that tells the reader what’s in it for<br />
her. Never allow readers to question why they are bothering to pay attention.</p>
<p>Each separate part of your narrative should have a main idea (something<br />
compelling) and a main purpose (to rile up the reader, to counter an opposing<br />
view, etc) that supports your bigger point and promise. Don’t digress,<br />
and don’t ramble. Stay laser focused.</p>
<p>Be ultra-specific in your assertions, and always make sure to give “reasons<br />
why.” General statements that are unsupported by specific facts cause a<br />
reader’s BS detector to go on high alert.</p>
<p>Demonstrate large amounts of credibility, using statistics, expert references<br />
and testimonials as appropriate. You must be authoritative – if you’re<br />
not an existing expert on a subject, you had better have done your research.</p>
<p>After building your credibility and authority, make sure you get back<br />
to the most important person around – the reader. What’s <span class="caps">STILL</span> in it<br />
for him? Restate the hook and the promise that got readers engaged in the<br />
first place.</p>
<p>Make an offer. Whether you’re selling a product or selling an idea, you’ve<br />
got to explicitly present it for acceptance by the reader. Be bold and firm<br />
when you present your offer, and relieve the reader’s risk of acceptance<br />
by standing behind what you say.</p>
<p>Sum everything up, returning full circle to your original promise and<br />
demonstrate how you’ve fulfilled it.</p>
<p>Find the benefits, although features may be enough for tech/biz as they&#8217;re<br />
looking for a solution</p>
<p>Make an offer &#8594; 30 minutes or less… or it’s free. (see Enchantment)</p>
<p>taking the buyer’s risk and shifting it over to yourself &#8594; money back<br />
guarantee</p>
<p>Use words that work with the people you’re trying to persuade.</p>
<p>Build a swipe file</p>
<p>Copyblogger uses quotes effectively</p>
<p>== Content Marketing</p>
<p>Content marketing is the creation of valuable content that has a marketing<br />
purpose. For example, my company creates an awesome special report, and<br />
we exchange it for your email address and your permission to educate you<br />
further about our stuff.</p>
<p>Copywriting is designed to get the reader to take a specific action. Sometimes<br />
that’s making a purchase, but it can also be confirming an email opt-in,<br />
calling for more information, or going into a store to check out the<br />
merchandise.</p>
<p>You still need: &#8211; Social proof (comments) &#8211; call to action</p>
<p>every piece of content must solve a problem and/or entertain.</p>
<p>When you do this consistently, your content becomes an appealing habit for<br />
your readers. When they see your name in their email box or a Twitter retweet,<br />
they know there will be something they like on the other side. And they’ll<br />
click through.</p>
<p>Use your content to address underlying objections that might keep someone from<br />
buying. Use it to tell interesting stories about how others have benefited<br />
from your offering. Use proven persuasion techniques to show your reader<br />
just how much she needs your product or service.</p>
<p>Successful salespeople will tell you that your customer needs to know,<br />
trust and like you before she’ll buy.</p>
<p>== Content ideas</p>
<p>3. Write a special report or white paper that addresses a thorny problem in<br />
an interesting way.</p>
<p>4. Create a free course delivered by email autoresponder</p>
<p>5. Write an educational series of blog posts designed to attract traffic<br />
for a competitive keyword phrase.</p>
<p>. Offer a free teleclass to build interest in your business.</p>
<p>Facebook page</p>
<p>17. Use any content vehicle to talk about how you’ve overcome a difficult<br />
problem related to your topic. Don’t try to be an infallible guru. Instead,<br />
be a smart, real person who has solved problems that your readers will<br />
find relevant.</p>
<p>20. Bring 5 or 6 of the strongest people in your topic together and create<br />
a virtual conference, with each presenter giving an audio or video workshop.</p>
<p>21. Hold a Tweetathon for your favorite charity.</p>
<p>22. Create a treasure hunt with some blogging friends.</p>
<p>25. Create a buyer’s guide.</p>
<p>26. Write an editorial for a dead-tree newspaper or magazine.</p>
<p>28. Collect weird stories from sources your readers don’t usually<br />
see. If your audience is made of particle physicists, gets stories from The<br />
Enquirer. Sift through and find the metaphors and analogies in these stories<br />
that will relate back to your topic.</p>
<p>29. Write an industry report on a hot topic. You’ll be surprised at how<br />
many high-profile folks will agree to a recorded Skype/phone interview for<br />
an industry report.</p>
<p>34. Review everything. Books, blogs, newsletters, tools, physical products,<br />
information products.</p>
<p>35. Take a topic that’s subject to information overload (maybe it’s “the<br />
coolest apps for your iPhone”) and make it manageable. Create a “10 Best”<br />
post that’s simple, user-friendly and gets the reader out of information fog.</p>
<p>37. If you’re stuck for content ideas, find a story on the Digg front<br />
page that has absolutely nothing to do with you. Then rewrite the story so<br />
it does. (You might keep nothing other than the headline. That’s fine. In<br />
fact, it’s probably ideal.)</p>
<p>38. Use headlines swiped from popular magazines. I’ve found Cosmo to be<br />
the most effective</p>
<p>39. Use your content to address every objection you’ve ever faced when<br />
trying to sell your product. Write interesting articles that show your<br />
product or service getting around these objections.</p>
<p>41. Create a useful tool (a checklist, spreadsheet-based calculator,<br />
cheat sheet, planning worksheet, etc.) that can be distributed to your blog<br />
subscribers or email list. These make great “thank yous” for subscribing<br />
to your site or autoresponder.</p>
<p>== Persuasive writing</p>
<p>Repetition</p>
<p>Of course, there’s good repetition and bad. To stay on the good side, make<br />
your point in several different ways, such as directly, using an example,<br />
in a story, via a quote from a famous person, and once more in your summary.</p>
<p>Reasons Why</p>
<p>Remember the power of the word because. Psychological studies have shown<br />
that people are more likely to comply with a request if you simply give them<br />
a reason why… even if that reason makes no sense.</p>
<p>Consistency consistency is associated with integrity and rational behavior.</p>
<p>Use this in your writing by getting the reader to agree with something up front<br />
that most people would have a hard time disagreeing with. Then rigorously<br />
make your case, with plenty of supporting evidence, all while relating your<br />
ultimate point back to the opening scenario that’s already been accepted.</p>
<p>Social Proof</p>
<p>Looking for guidance from others as to what to do and what to accept is one<br />
of the most powerful psychological forces in our lives. It can determine<br />
whether we deliver aid to a person in need, and it can determine whether we<br />
muster the courage to kill ourselves.</p>
<p>Obvious examples of social proof can be found in testimonials and outside<br />
referrals, and it’s the driving force behind social media. But you can<br />
also casually integrate elements of social proof in your writing, ranging<br />
from skillful alignment with outside authorities to blatant name dropping.<br />
Comparisons</p>
<p>Metaphors, similes and analogies are the persuasive writer’s best<br />
friends. When you can relate your scenario to something that the reader<br />
already accepts as true, you’re well on your way to convincing someone to<br />
see things your way.</p>
<p>But comparisons work in other ways too. Sometimes you can be more<br />
persuasive by comparing apples to oranges (to use a tired but effective<br />
metaphor). Don’t compare the price of your home study course to the price<br />
of a similar course—compare it to the price of a live seminar or your<br />
hourly consulting rate.</p>
<p>Agitate and Solve</p>
<p>This is a persuasion theme that works as an overall approach to making your<br />
case. First, you identify the problem and qualify your audience. Then you<br />
agitate the reader’s pain before offering your solution as the answer that<br />
will make it all better.</p>
<p>The agitation phase is not about being sadistic; it’s about empathy. You<br />
want the reader to know unequivocally that you understand his problem<br />
because you’ve dealt with it and/or are experienced at eliminating it. The<br />
credibility of your solution goes way up if you demonstrate that you truly<br />
feel the prospect’s pain.  Prognosticate</p>
<p>Another persuasion theme involves providing your readers with a glimpse into<br />
the future. If you can convincingly present an extrapolation of current events<br />
into likely future outcomes, you may as well have a license to print money.</p>
<p>This entire strategy is built on credibility. If you have no idea what you’re<br />
talking about, you’ll end up looking foolish. But if you can back up your<br />
claims with your credentials or your obvious grasp of the subject matter,<br />
this is an extremely persuasive technique.  Go Tribal</p>
<p>Despite our attempts to be sophisticated, evolved beings, we humans are<br />
exclusionary by nature. Give someone a chance to be a part of a group that<br />
they want to be in—whether that be wealthy, or hip, or green, or even<br />
contrarian—and they’ll hop on board whatever train you’re driving.</p>
<p>This is the technique used in the greatest sales letter ever written. Find<br />
out what group people want to be in, and offer them an invitation to join<br />
while seemingly excluding others.</p>
<p>Address Objections</p>
<p>If you present your case and someone is left thinking “yeah, but…”,<br />
well, you’ve lost. This is why direct marketers use long copy—it’s not<br />
that they want you to read it all, it’s that they want you to read enough<br />
until you buy.</p>
<p>Addressing all the potential objections of at least the majority of your<br />
readers can be tough, but if you really know your subject the arguments<br />
against you should be fairly obvious. If you think there are no reasonable<br />
objections to your position, you’re in for a shock if you have comments<br />
enabled.  Storytelling</p>
<p>Storytelling is really a catch-all technique—you can and should use it in<br />
combination with any and all of the previous nine strategies. But the reason<br />
why storytelling works so well lies at the heart of what persuasion really is.</p>
<p>Stories allow people to persuade themselves, and that’s what it’s really<br />
all about. You might say that we never convince anyone of anything—we<br />
simply help others independently decide that we’re right. Do everything<br />
you can to tell better stories, and you’ll find that you are a terribly<br />
persuasive person.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, this is in no way a complete list. What other persuasive<br />
writing strategies work for you?</p>
<p>== Creating customers</p>
<p>See above, then &#8230;</p>
<p>When you’re ready to take an order, send your loyal fan to a well-crafted<br />
landing page. That page does the most explicit selling, with a killer offer<br />
and a clear, direct call to action.</p>
<p>== Overview</p>
<p>Pillar 1: Relationships</p>
<p>It’s about having consummate respect, always, for your audience and your<br />
market.  It’s about focusing almost obsessively on their needs, over and<br />
above your own (and getting what you want, almost magically, in the process).<br />
It’s about making a commitment to creating a quality experience for your<br />
readers and subscribers.</p>
<p>Pillar 2: Direct response copywriting</p>
<p>Old fashioned copywriting</p>
<p>Starting with a killer headline and moving strategically through the copy to<br />
a stirring call to action, traditional copywriting technique works amazingly<br />
well in social media.</p>
<p>Pillar 3: Content marketing</p>
<p>keep delivering great content, but in a strategic and focused way.</p>
<p>Every once in awhile, make a great offer that benefits the reader and involves<br />
the exchange of cash money.</p>
<p>Pillar 4: Have something worth selling</p>
<p>== Coming up with ideas</p>
<p>Google alerts Read your competitors Riff on a popular post. Grab yourself<br />
some high-powered linkage by posting your reaction to a big-time blogger’s<br />
thoughts.  Think about pain. What are the biggest problems your readers<br />
face? Focus on topics that would provide balm to their wounds.  # Tackle a<br />
controversy. Weigh in on your industry’s hot topic. This can be especially<br />
effective if you have a contrarian viewpoint.  # Join a blogger’s<br />
group. Knowing your group will ask what you’re posting should help<br />
concentrate the mind. Hearing what they’re blogging on will no doubt suggest<br />
subjects for you to cover, too.  # Scan industry conference schedules. The list<br />
of session topics offers a quick guide to your audience’s hot-button issues.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get a critique. Find a mentor. Have them look over your blog and point<br />
out what’s missing.  # Do an interview. Do you have a favorite thinker in<br />
your space? Get in touch. You’ll be surprised how many authors and thought<br />
leaders are game for a quick Q&amp;A.  # Review your greatest hits. Read your<br />
most popular past blogs. Look for ways to take a slightly different angle<br />
and further illuminate the same topic.  # Talk about your mistakes. Folks<br />
love to hear about how other people screwed up. Be honest and talk about<br />
what you learned.  # Make a prediction. Everybody — everybody — wants<br />
to know what’s going to happen next. Grab attention with your thoughts<br />
on the future of your sector.  # Review the past. How has your industry<br />
changed in the past 5 years? 10 years? Look for milestones for reflection.</li>
	<li>Create a regular feature. For instance, if you do a weekly news wrapup<br />
every Saturday, that’s one post you know you have covered.  # Where are<br />
they now? If you know of an industry bigwig who’s been out of the spotlight<br />
but now they’re back, check in with them. Write about their new venture.<br />
Keep a journal. Ideally, that you write in first or last thing daily, when<br />
you’re unfocused and allow uncensored thoughts.  # Do a book review. Tell<br />
readers if the hot new book in your niche is insightful or inane.  # Do a<br />
product review. Ditto the book reviews, only for stuff. Is it a ripoff, or<br />
valuable?  # Run your analytics. The most popular keyword phrases that bring<br />
people to your site provide a ready-made road map to your next post topics.</li>
	<li>Read your comments. See what readers have asked about that you haven’t<br />
answered yet.  # Read your competitors’ comments. If your blog doesn’t have<br />
a lot of comments yet, go mine someone else’s.  # Read your social-media<br />
group’s questions. What are people chatting about? Answer on your blog,<br />
then go back and provide a link.  # Hit an industry networking event. As<br />
you chat people up, mention your blog. Ask what they like to read about.</li>
	<li>Attend a local community event. Compete in a zucchini race, volunteer<br />
at a charity auction. Get out of your head and laugh a little.  # Think<br />
funny. While you’re laughing, consider writing a post that’s satirical or<br />
humorous for a change. I know funny bloggers are among my personal favorites.<br />
Take the headline challenge. Tell yourself you need to come up with 50 story<br />
ideas today, or else. Jot down anything and everything. (This one helped me<br />
write this post.)  # Take the one-hour challenge. You must find a post idea<br />
in the next hour. Go downtown, stick your head in shops, chat people up.</li>
	<li>Recruit a guest. Or two. When all else fails, call for backup. Sometimes<br />
you just need to take the pressure off so your post-generator has a little<br />
time to recuperate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Build relationships months in advance of pitching</p>
<p>== Fast article writing</p>
<p>1. Keep an idea list.  2. Let your ideas incubate.  3. Edit before you start to<br />
be brutal. Cut out any supporting idea that doesn’t fit with the main topic<br />
of the article.  You can always use the ideas you don’t need for later posts.<br />
4. Use bullet points 5. Keep it short about 500 words 6. Come back later If<br />
you find that you’re stuck, don’t try to force the words to come. Save<br />
the article and work on something else for awhile.  7. Never save a good<br />
idea Do the articles you know will come easily and make the most of that time.</p>
