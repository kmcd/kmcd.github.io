   <p>= Questions</p>
<p>What are the key chapters?</p>
<ul>
	<li>ch 3, MA</li>
	<li>ch 8, <span class="caps">MACD</span></li>
	<li>ch 9, MA trading channels</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the different types of moving average (eg <span class="caps">EMA</span>) and what are their<br />
significance ?</p>
<p>What are the most effective MA long range timeframes (50/200 day) ?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Long term not as useful for day trading, 5d MA is best</li>
</ul>
<p>= Action points</p>
<p>Calculate 10 day, 5 day, 5 min <span class="caps">MACD</span> for all <span class="caps">NASDAQ</span> stocks in Sep/Aug 2011.</p>
<p>Find stocks above their long term (10-30) week MA</p>
<ul>
	<li>how many stocks on average?</li>
	<li>how long do they stay above their long term MA?</li>
</ul>
<p>What are your long term entry signals?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gainers/<span class="caps">MACD</span>/MA ?</li>
	<li>= Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving averages</p>
<ul>
	<li>a series of diminishing upside pulses suggests the end of a trend</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>a series of increasing upside pulses suggest further advances</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>stock markets are described as bullish when they are above their 30 week MA</li>
	<li>10 or 20 week time periods may</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Market stages: transition, rising, topping, declining, basing.</li>
	<li>Rate of change indicator</li>
	<li>Momentum (golf ball driven off the tee metaphor)</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Should be positive during an uptrend</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Overbought/sold means momentum is out of normal range</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>&gt; Not sure how useful momentum is for predicting price action</li>
	<li>the weekly breadth impulse signal is based upon the princi-<br />
ple that strong initial impulses in market advances&#8212;the rapid development of over-<br />
bought, or extended to the upside momentum readingsare actually more IikeIy to<br />
be the precursor to further advances than to downside market reversals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">EMA</span> of issued shares, # advancing/declining, differential</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Daily-Based Breadth Impulse Signal generates buy signals when it rises to or above</li>
	<li>61.5%; such signals are cancelled when the indicator declines to or below 49%. Signals occur</li>
	<li>infrequently but have been very reliable historicall</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Only 26 signals generated in 34 years! Is this still the case?</li>
	<li><span class="caps">MACD</span></li>
	<li>subtracting a longer-term exponential moving average</li>
	<li>from a shorter-term exponential moving average of prices or other measure</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>generally rises if shorter-term trends are gaining strength and</li>
	<li>generally declines if shorter-term trends are losing strength</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Downtrends are below 0 OR above 0 and falling</li>
	<li>Uptrends are above 0 and rising</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Long term average is 2-3x the shorter MA</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span class="caps">MACD</span> signals are more likely to prove reliable if shorter-term <span class="caps">MACD</span> signals an</li>
	<li>confirmed by longer-term trends in the stock market, perhaps reflected by longer</li>
	<li>term <span class="caps">MACD</span> patterns.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>the signal line is an exponential average of <span class="caps">MACD</span> levels, not of</li>
	<li>the price of the investment vehicle or index that is being tracked.</li>
	<li>created employing three-day to nine-day exponential averages of <span class="caps">MACD</span> lines.</li>
	<li>the shorter the average is, the more sensitive the signal line will be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>crossings of <span class="caps">MACD</span> from below to above its signal line can</li>
	<li>be taken as confirmations of buy signals originally indicated when changes in</li>
	<li>direction have taken place in <span class="caps">MACD</span> from down to up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>signal line crossings take place after <span class="caps">MACD</span> lines change direction</li>
	<li>but usually before <span class="caps">MACD</span> limes have crossed the 0 line.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>greater net gains generally occur if</li>
	<li>reversals in <span class="caps">MACD</span> (especially slower-moving combinations) are employed for buy-</li>
	<li>ing and selling rather than crossings of signal lines.</li>
	<li>&gt; is this because its not a strong uptrend util it crosses the 0 line?</li>
	<li>(crossing the signal line could merely be downtrend rally)</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Buy signals are much more reliable when the <span class="caps">MACD</span> has crossed from above to</li>
	<li>below 0 at some time since the most recent sell signal.</li>
	<li>The <span class="caps">MACD</span> does not</li>
	<li>have to be below 0 at the time of the buy signal, but it should have been below</li>
	<li>0 at some time since the start of the recent decline.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Negative divergences are said to take place when price levels of the investment in</li>
	<li>question reach new highs, but measures that reflect upside market momentum fail</li>
	<li>to reach new positive areas.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Positive divergences are said to take place when price levels of the investment in</li>
	<li>question fall to new lows for the cycle, but measures that reflect downside market</li>
	<li>momentum fail to decline to more negative areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Divergences suggest a more or less imminent market reversal ahead,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>aka Down/Up ward rally</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>more accurate <span class="caps">MACD</span> buy and sell signals can often be secured by</li>
	<li>using more sensitive <span class="caps">MACD</span> combinations for buying purposes and less sensitive <span class="caps">MACD</span></li>
	<li>combinations for selling purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Stock prices decline at more rapid rates than they rise</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You should maintain at least two <span class="caps">MACD</span> combinations: a faster one for buying</li>
	<li>and a slower one for selling.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>When market trends are very positive, buy very fast and sell very slow. You can</li>
	<li>employ the 6-19 combination for buying, or you can employ the somewhat more</li>
	<li>reliable 12-26 combination. The 19- to 39day combination is used for selling.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>the use o f a slower <span class="caps">MACD</span> combination oroduced more time-oly sell signals than</li>
	<li>if the mbre rapid <span class="caps">MACD</span> combination, excellent for buying during this period,</li>
	<li>was used for selling as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Exit signals</li>
	<li>The stock market must be in an uptrend that can be defined by a rising 50-day</li>
	<li>moving average. A slow <span class="caps">MACD</span> combination is employed for selling.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li><span class="caps">MACD</span> does encounter occasional difficulty in dealing with</li>
	<li>steadily trending, narrow-channeled market advances or declines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Intraday price ranges are often fairly narrow, so it i more important in day</li>
	<li>trading than in position trading to establish positions as early as possible.</li>
	<li>&gt; Should you buy <sub>below</sub> the 0 line? This should be tested!</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>ability to define market re-entry junctures following serious intermediate- and long-</li>
	<li>term market declines</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Recommended time frames:</li>
	<li>1, 5, 20 days</li>
	<li>5, 30, 6 mins</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Signal lines will usually be six- to</li>
	<li>nine-unit exponential moving averages of the <span class="caps">MACD</span> lines. Shorter-term signal lines</li>
	<li>will often produce more timely signals but will also be more prone to false signals</li>
	<li>and whipsaws.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>maintain an appropriatetrend-defining moving average. The 50-unit moving average tends to work well</li>
</ul>
<p>MA trading channels</p>
<ul>
	<li>moving averages are tools for smoothing price data that</li>
	<li>clarify the direction and strength of underlying market trends by removing noise</li>
	<li>associated with short-term price fluctuations</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The longer the term of the moving</li>
	<li>average is, the longer the trend it will reflect, and the smoother and slower changes</li>
	<li>will be in direction of the average.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Uses +/- 8% instead of std dev Bollinger bands</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Uses Relative Strength Indicator (<span class="caps">RSI</span>), a measure of market momentum</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>If a market top or market low indicated by the action of price move-</li>
	<li>ment within the moving average trading channel is confirmed by supporting</li>
	<li>technical indicators, the odds of a trend reversal taking place increase. A syner-</li>
	<li>gistic approach to trading bands is definitely useful.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>&gt; Can you use <span class="caps">RSI</span> as a confirming sell signal?</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>20 day MA = approx. 40 day trend</li>
	<li>Putting it all together</li>
	<li>Identify long term trend (eg 200d MA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons learned after 40 years</p>
<ul>
	<li>The news/media are usually the last to know</li>
	<li>Attend meetups/conferences but <sub>work</sub> alone</li>
	<li>Keep results private</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>traders often tend to close out their stron-</li>
	<li>gest positions too early (locking up the profit) and maintain their weakest</li>
	<li>positions for too long</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>even the best timing models tend to be profitable only a</li>
	<li>certain percentage of the time, but their winning trades are much larger, on</li>
	<li>average, than their losing trades</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The name of the game is to make a good (but not unreasonably good) return</li>
	<li>for your time and capital, not to feel &#8220;smart.&#8221;</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t confuse rising stock prices with being a financial genius</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>For most people, in-and-out trading will not be as profitable as well-considered</li>
	<li>intermediate-term trading, . It is not easy to overcome the additional costs in</li>
	<li>transaction expenses and bid-ask spreads involved in day trading and very</li>
	<li>short-term trading</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>It is better to miss a profit than to take a loss</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>it is probably best not to operate at the market opening.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Do not enter into an invested position without an exit plan.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>It is much better to trade with no more capital than you can comfortably risk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Make note of your losing transactions. Have you violated some basic rules of</li>
	<li>trading or investing because of some emotional reason? There will be losses.</li>
	<li>Not every losing trade is a mistake. The stock market, at best, is a game of</li>
	<li>probabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>There is no need to be invested in the stock market at all times. If mat-</li>
	<li>ters appear unclear or if you are less certain than usual (there&#8217;s no such thing as</li>
	<li>certainty regarding stocks), be free to simply stand aside until matters clarify.</li>
</ul>
