   <p>= Questions</p>
<p>What are your action points/outputs ?</p>
<p>What chapters can you omit ?</p>
<p>How can you use this to validate business models ?</p>
<p>== Chapter 2: How to find a problem worth solving</p>
<p>Customer/problem fit<br />
1. List top 3 problems<br />
2. List existing alternatives<br />
3. Identify other user roles<br />
4. Hone in on possible early adopters</p>
<p>Unique Value Proposition: A single, clear compelling message that states why you are<br />
different and worth buying.</p>
<p>Be different, but make sure your difference matters<br />
The key to unlocking what’s different about your product is deriving your<br />
<span class="caps">UVP</span> directly from the #1 problem you are solving.</p>
<p>Target early adopters</p>
<p>Focus on finished story benefits<br />
A good <span class="caps">UVP</span> gets inside the head of your customers and focusses<br />
on the benefits your customers derive after using your product.</p>
<p>Picking a few “key” words that you consistently use also drives your <span class="caps">SEO</span><br />
ranking.</p>
<p>Answer: What, Who, and Why<br />
A good <span class="caps">UVP</span> needs to clearly answer the first 2 questions &#8211; what is your<br />
product and who is the customer.</p>
<p>Study other good UVPs<br />
The best way to craft a good <span class="caps">UVP</span> is to study the UVPs of the brands you<br />
admire. Visit their landing pages and deconstruct how and why their<br />
messaging works.</p>
<p>&gt; reminds me of &#8220;have a mantra&#8221;, Guy Kawasaki &amp; Jason Fried</p>
<p>A high-concept pitch<br />
usually builds on other familiar concepts to quickly get an idea across and<br />
make it easily spreadable.</p>
<p>&gt; or use a <span class="caps">STORY</span>!</p>
<p>Bind a solution to your problem as late as possible.</p>
<p>Sales Channels / route to market</p>
<p>In addition to defining the right product to build, it’s just as critical to start<br />
finding, building and testing a significant path to your customers from day<br />
one.</p>
<p>Example inbound channels: Blogs, <span class="caps">SEO</span>, E-books, white papers, webinars.<br />
Example outbound channels: <span class="caps">SEM</span>, print/TV ads, trade shows, cold calling.</p>
<p>direct sales only make sense in businesses where the<br />
aggregate lifetime value of the customers exceeds the total compensation of<br />
your direct salespeople (b2b &amp; enterprise)</p>
<p>a learning channel, direct sales is one of the most effective since you<br />
interact face-to-face with the customer</p>
<p>Content Marketing uses a combination of Content, Search Engine<br />
Optimization (<span class="caps">SEO</span>), and Social Media to work. Rather than crafting the<br />
“perfect outbound message”, you instead incrementally test various aspects<br />
of your Problem/Solution using inbound channels like blogs, white papers,<br />
and webinars</p>
<p>Content Marketing isn’t free, takes time to build, and does cost time. But<br />
when it starts to work, “Content Marketing” turns from an expense into an<br />
asset. It could even become your “Unfair Advantage”.</p>
<p>“Find the key number that tells you how your business is doing in real time, before you<br />
get the sales report.”<br />
&gt; Signups, Cancellations, <span class="caps">LTV</span></p>
<p>“A real unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought.”</p>
<p>Your objective is to find a big enough market you can reach with<br />
customers who need your product that will pay a price you can build a<br />
business around.</p>
<p>1. Customer pain level<br />
Pick customer segments that need your product the most. The goal is to<br />
have one or more of your top three problems as must-haves for them.</p>
<p>2. Ease of reach<br />
Building a path to customers is one of the harder aspects of building a<br />
successful product. If you have an easier path to one segment of customers<br />
over others, take that into consideration. It doesn’t guarantee you’ll find a<br />
problem worth solving or a viable business model, but it will get you out of<br />
building faster and speed up your learning.</p>
<p>= Chapter 3: Get ready to interview customers</p>
<p>Surveys assume you know the right questions to ask<br />
Customer Discovery is about exploring what you don’t know you don’t know.<br />
The best initial learning comes from “open-ended” questions.<br />
You can’t see the customer during a survey</p>
<p>&gt; Once you&#8217;ve talked to customers, could you use sales instead of surveys?</p>
<p>Another commonly used tactic is to put up a teaser page, drive some traffic<br />
to it, and measure the results. Metrics can only tell you what actions your<br />
visitors are taking (or not), but not why. Did they abandon because of your<br />
copy, graphics, pricing, something else? You could endlessly try various<br />
combinations, or you could just ask the customers.</p>
<p>The 3 Must-haves: Development, Design, Marketing</p>
<p>Marketing drives the external perception of<br />
your product and you need people that can put themselves in the shoes of<br />
your customer. Good copywriting and communication skills are key here<br />
along with an understanding of metrics, pricing, and positioning.</p>
<p>&gt; According to Rob Walling, you should outsource Design, maybe development too &amp;<br />
concentrate on Marketing</p>
<p>In order to build a successful product, you have to eventually find a scalable<br />
and repeatable way to reach customers.</p>
<p>it’s not as much the uncovering of the path [to market] but the building of the <br />
path that is troublesome.</p>
<p>It’s comparatively a lot easier to find 30-50 people to interview, validate<br />
you have a problem worth solving, build a <span class="caps">MVP</span>, even get them to pay you –<br />
all of which is a false positive if it was predicated on a customer<br />
acquisition approach that won’t scale or more importantly be applicable to<br />
how you acquire customers in the future.</p>
<p>Create a landing page<br />
- domain name<br />
- <span class="caps">UVP</span><br />
- email capture</p>
<p>The objective right now is grabbing attention by articulating a problem that resonates<br />
with your visitors &#8211; not pitching your product.</p>
<p>Start a blog<br />
&gt; This is too much time to evaluate &amp; validate your business model</p>
<p>Keep personal &amp; product blogs seperate</p>
<p>The main purpose of your blog is to out-teach your competition and connect with <br />
customers. Rather than blogging about the product, go one or two levels higher and<br />
blog about the larger problem domain.</p>
<p>== Find prospects</p>
<p>I recommend preparing yourself to interview 30-60 people over a 4-6 week<br />
period which comes to talking to 2-3 customers a day with some time built-<br />
in for iteration.</p>
<p>I recommend speaking to no fewer than 10 people for the Problem Interview and 20<br />
people for the Solution Interview.</p>
<p>People are generally willing to help if you set the right expectation of<br />
seeking their advice over trying to pitch to them</p>
<p>Don’t pay prospects or provide other incentives</p>
<p>Consider outsourcing interview scheduling</p>
<p>Here’s how I have made this work:<br />
- I script all my email requests for interviews<br />
- I clear my afternoons so it’s easy to schedule interviews<br />
- I’m copied in all the emails so I can intervene when needed.</p>
<p>How to Find Prospects</p>
<p>The first place to start is with your immediate contacts that meet your<br />
target customer demographic.</p>
<p>The next step is asking your 1 degree contacts for introductions to people<br />
that meet your customer demographic.</p>
<p>3. Email list from teaser page<br />
Reach out to them and ask if they’d be willing to spend 20-30 mins with you on <br />
a call.</p>
<p>4. Cold Calling/Emailing/LinkedIn</p>
<p>“Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems.”</p>
<p>Your main objective here is identifying your early adopters and learning<br />
how they currently solve these problems.</p>
<p>An early adopter is a customer who ranks one or more of the problems you’re solving<br />
as a must-have and will generally pay to have it solved.</p>
<p>Your competitors are <span class="caps">NOT</span> who you think they are <span class="caps">BUT</span> who your customers think they<br />
are.</p>
<p>Before you can really define a solution, you have to really understand the problem.</p>
<p>Customer Segments: Who has the pain?<br />
• How to identify early-adopters?</p>
<p>Problem: What are you solving?<br />
• How do customers rank the top 3 problems?<br />
• What is their pain level: must-have, nice-to-have, don’t-need?<br />
• How do customers solve these problems today?</p>
<p>Interviewing</p>
<p>My interviews typically run between 20-30 mins without feeling rushed.<br />
Make sure you set the right time expectations upfront and are respectful of<br />
their time.</p>
<p>Stick to a script</p>
<p>Document results immediately after the interview</p>
<p>Tell a Story (Set Problem Context)<br />
Problem Ranking (Test Problem)<br />
Explore Customer’s Worldview (Test Solution)<br />
- how do you solve the problem today ?<br />
Ask for a referral</p>
<p>Refine the problems<br />
Really understand their existing alternatives<br />
Identify the potential paths to reaching early adopters</p>
<p>You are done when you have interviewed at least 10 people and<br />
• can identify the demographics of an early adopter<br />
• have a must-have problem and<br />
• can describe how customers solve this problem today</p>
<p>Solution interview</p>
<p>Customer Segments: Who are your early-adopters?<br />
• Can you accurately describe your early-adopters?</p>
<p>Problem: What is the problem you are solving?<br />
• What is the #1 must-have problem?<br />
• How is it addressed today?</p>
<p>Solution: How will you solve these problems?<br />
• What is the minimum feature set needed to launch?</p>
<p>Revenue Streams: What is the Pricing Model?<br />
• Will customers pay for a solution?<br />
• What price will they bear?</p>
<p>Build a demo</p>
<p>If you don’t sense a strong problem resonance, don’t continue with the<br />
Solution Interview, but rather use the Problem Interview script to learn<br />
more about how they solve these problems today.</p>
<p>Go through each problem in turn and illustrate how you solve it using the<br />
supporting mockup.<br />
Which of the screenshots resonated with you the most?<br />
Which could you live without?<br />
Are there any additional features you think are missing?</p>
<p>Usually the right price is one the customer accepts but with a little resistance.</p>
<p>If you believe there are high switching costs or barriers to adoption,<br />
consider using Steve Blank’s method of asking if they would use a solution<br />
if it were “Free” before testing a price.</p>
<p>What is the Solution Interview exit criteria?<br />
You are done when you can confidently<br />
• identify the demographics of an early adopter,<br />
• have a must-have problem<br />
• can define the minimum features needed to solve this problem<br />
• have a price the customer is willing to pay<br />
• that you can build a business around (using a back-of-the-envelope calculation).</p>
