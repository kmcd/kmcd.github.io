<p>= Notes</p>
<p>An asset is something that you own which earns money.</p>
<p>A liability is the opposite of an asset, something that costs you money</p>
<p>When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow <br />
to pay for the house.</p>
<p>concentrate your efforts on only buying income-generating assets</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller:<br />
Wealth is a person&#8217;s ability to survive<br />
so many number of days forward&#8230; or if I stopped working today, how long could<br />
I survive?</p>
<p>You should recieve your income from your assets</p>
<p>There is a big difference between your profession and your business. (you own<br />
your business but you work in your profession)</p>
<p>Real assets fall into several different categories:<br />
1. Businesses that do not require my presence. I own them, but they are<br />
managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it&#8217;s not a business.<br />
It becomes my job.<br />
2. Stocks.<br />
3. Bonds.<br />
4. Mutual funds.<br />
5. Income-generating real estate.<br />
6. Notes (lOUs).<br />
7. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents.<br />
8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and<br />
has a ready market.</p>
<p>90% of new companies <span class="caps">FAIL</span> in the 1st five years! Is this because they didn&#8217;t <br />
execute very well?</p>
<p>Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working employee, but keep building that <br />
asset column.</p>
<p>Financial IQ<br />
Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements.</p>
<p>No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This<br />
involves strategies and formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative<br />
side.</p>
<p>No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is<br />
a need to know the &#8220;technical&#8221; aspects of the market, which is emotion driven;<br />
The other market factor is the &#8220;fundamental&#8221; or the<br />
economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not<br />
make sense based on the current market conditions.</p>
<p>No. 4 is the law. For instance, utilizing a corporation wrapped around the<br />
technical skills of accounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth.<br />
An individual with the knowledge of the tax advantages and protection provided<br />
by a corporation can get rich so much faster than someone who is an employee or<br />
a small-business sole proprietor. It&#8217;s like the difference between someone<br />
walking and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes to long-<br />
term wealth.</p>
<ul>
	<li>1. Tax advantages: A corporation can do so many things that an individual</li>
	<li>cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes.</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>2. Protection from lawsuits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding<br />
marketing. It is the ability to sell&#8212;therefore, to communicate to another human<br />
being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse or child-that is the base skill<br />
of personal success. It is communication skills such as writing, speaking and<br />
negotiating that are crucial to a life of success. It is a skill that I work on<br />
constantly, attending courses or buying educational tapes to expand my knowledge.</p>
<p>The five reasons are:<br />
1. Fear.<br />
2. Cynicism.<br />
3. Laziness.<br />
4. Bad habits.<br />
5. Arrogance.</p>
<p>&#8220;buyer&#8217;s remorse&#8221; (paradox of choice?)</p>
<p>tax lien<br />
certificates instead of CDs. I earn 16 percent per year on my money, which<br />
certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers.</p>
<p>Cynics criticize, and winners analyze</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford it&#8221; shut down your brain. It didn&#8217;t have to think anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I afford it&#8217;&#8221; opened up the brain. Forced it to think and search for answers.</p>
<p>When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by<br />
finding an expert in the field or find a book on the subject.</p>
<p><span class="caps">INVEST</span> <span class="caps">FIRST</span> IN <span class="caps">EDUCATION</span>:<br />
- invest in learning about investing.<br />
- seminars<br />
- audiobooks<br />
- day trading<br />
- who was that mixergy guy with the day trading course?</p>
<p>4. <span class="caps">MASTER</span> A <span class="caps">FORMULA</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">THEN</span> <span class="caps">LEARN</span> A <span class="caps">NEW</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span>: The power of learning<br />
quickly. In order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe</p>
<p>&#8220;You become what you study.&#8221;<br />
I learned a formula. The next trick was to have the discipline to actually put<br />
into action what I had learned.</p>
<p>- Can you use code as your secret weapon for these formulae?</p>
<p>5. <span class="caps">PAY</span> <span class="caps">YOURSELF</span> <span class="caps">FIRST</span>: The power of self-discipline. If you cannot get<br />
control of yourself, do not try to get rich.</p>
<p>Simply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for<br />
financial pressure can never, and I mean never, be rich.</p>
<p>1. Management of cash flow.<br />
2. Management of people.<br />
3. Management of personal time.</p>
<p>&#8594; Find self-liquidating assets (Dave Bullock); ie assets that will pay for <br />
themselves, eg McDonalds buys real estate and franchies the property for cash<br />
flow</p>
<p>. Don&#8217;t get into large debt positions that you have to pay for.<br />
Keep your expenses low. Build up assets first. Then, buy the big house or nice car.<br />
Being stuck in the rat race is not intelligent.<br />
2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and don&#8217;t dip into your<br />
savings or investments.<br />
Use the pressure to inspire your financial genius to<br />
come up with new ways of making more money and then pay your bills. You will<br />
have increased your ability to make more money as well as your financial<br />
intelligence. ; : So many times I have gotten into financial hot water, and used<br />
my brain to create more income, while staunchly defending the assets in my asset<br />
column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I was like a good<br />
trooper defending the fort, Fort Assets.</p>
<p>Poor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently called<br />
&#8220;Dipping into savings.&#8221; The rich know that savings are only used to create more<br />
money, not to pay bills.</p>
<p>6. <span class="caps">PAY</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BROKERS</span> <span class="caps">WELL</span>: they should <strong>make</strong> you money (Andy Fuller is a good<br />
case in point)</p>
<p>look at more than <span class="caps">ROI</span>; it&#8217;s the assets you get for free once you get your money back.</p>
<p>Use assets to purchase luxuries, eg car. <br />
- this reminds me of 4 hour work week dream lining + muses</p>
<p>9. <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">NEED</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">HEROES</span>: The power of myth.<br />
- who are <sub>your</sub> heroes?<br />
- should you cultivate &amp; learn about your heroes?</p>
<p>10. <span class="caps">TEACH</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">SHALL</span> <span class="caps">RECEIVE</span>: The power of giving.</p>
<p>Whenever I feel that people aren&#8217;t smiling at me, I simply<br />
begin smiling and saying hello, and like magic, there are suddenly more smiling<br />
people around me. It is true that your world is only a mirror of you.</p>
<p>the more I sincerely teach those who want to learn, the more I learn. If you want to<br />
learn about money, teach it to someone else. A torrent of new ideas and finer<br />
distinctions will come in.<br />
- reminds me of pragmatic wetware</p>
<p>• Stop doing what you&#8217;re doing. In other words, take a break and assess<br />
what is working and what is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the<br />
same thing and expecting a different result. Stop doing what is not working and<br />
look for something new to do.</p>
<p>• Look for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and look<br />
for books on different and unique subjects. I call them formulas. I buy how-to<br />
books on a formula I know nothing about. For example, it was in the bookstore<br />
that I found the book The 16 Percent Solution, by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the<br />
book and read it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TAKE</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span>!</p>
<p>• Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask<br />
them for tips, for little tricks of the trade. As for 16 percent tax lien<br />
certificates, I went to the county tax office and found the government employee<br />
who worked in the office. I found out that she, too, invested in the tax liens.<br />
Immediately, she was invited to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything<br />
she knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all afternoon showing me<br />
everything. By the next day, I found two great properties with her help and have<br />
been accruing interest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the book,<br />
a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to acquire two great deals.</p>
<p>• Take classes and buy tapes. I search the newspapers for new and<br />
interesting classes. Many are for free or a small fee. I also attend and pay for<br />
expensive seminars on what I want to learn.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no idea<br />
what it feels like to be trying to sell something. I have had a piece of real<br />
estate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed anything.</p>
<p>And I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an<br />
offer with the words &#8220;subject to approval of business partner.&#8221; I never specify<br />
who the business partner is. Most people do not know my partner is my cat.</p>
<p>• As for stocks, I like Peter Lynch&#8217;s book Beating the Street for his<br />
formula for selecting stocks that grow in value.</p>
<p>• I look for people who want to buy first, then I look for someone who<br />
wants to sell.<br />
- reminds me of 4 steps &amp; 4 hour work week: pre-sale orders for your non-existent<br />
app</p>
