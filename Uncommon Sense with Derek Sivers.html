<p>Transcript</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Derek Sivers. I’m often asked to speak at conferences or<br />
seminars to entrepreneurs about everything I learned building, starting, and<br />
selling a company. The funny thing is I’ve done it many times at conferences<br />
and I’m very comfortable speaking to big rooms of hundreds of people,<br />
but I’ve never actually recorded it. So this is really kind of weird for<br />
me to be talking into a camera. So please be kind and I will try tell you<br />
everything I know, everything I learned in ten years, but I’ll try to do<br />
it in 30 or 40 minutes, or something like that.  Ready? Okay.  So first, my<br />
background, for context. I decided when I was 14 years old that I wanted to<br />
be a professional musician, for real, not just being a rock star, but really<br />
being a professional musician making my full-time living from music, and I<br />
did it. But the funny thing is that deciding this from a young age gets you<br />
into a certain mindset that I think is exactly the same as the entrepreneur<br />
mindset, because I know from a young age that I would never have a job. I’d<br />
never have a salary.  I would never have insurance, pension, job security,<br />
or all those other things that people in the of day job, steady job, career<br />
kind of mindset get used to. So 20 years later, people in interviews sometimes<br />
will ask me things like, “How did you get the courage to quit your job and<br />
focus on your dream?” I was like, “No, I never was in that mindset. I<br />
never had the steady job to quit.  It was always this idea that everything I<br />
was going to do in life was going to come from my own two hands.  There was<br />
no such thing as steady income. Everything you earned is going to be because<br />
of something you do.” So maybe I was in this entrepreneur mindset anyway.<br />
But in 1997 or so, I put out my own CD and sold about 1,500 copies at live<br />
shows, and I wanted to get it up and selling online, but there was not a single<br />
place to sell your CD online at the time. Amazon was just a bookstore. PayPal<br />
didn’t exist yet, and there were a few big online record stores, but they<br />
were really just a front end to the major label distribution system. So I<br />
built a little shopping cart to sell my own CD, and some of my friends said,<br />
“Hey, could you sell my CD through that too?” And I said, “Sure, no<br />
problem,” and I did it as a favor. Pretty soon friends of friends started<br />
calling, and I started getting these calls from strangers saying, “Hey,<br />
man, my friend Dave said you could sell my CD.” And</p>
<p>I’d say, “Yeah, no problem.” And I’d set up people on my little<br />
website as a favor, but after a while I realized I had accidentally started<br />
a business.  The thing is I didn’t want to start a business because I<br />
was making my full-time living just doing music. I was actually living<br />
in a house in Woodstock, New York with the money I had made touring and<br />
playing on people’s records, producing people’s records, and all that<br />
kind of stuff. The last thing I wanted was for something to get in the<br />
way of that. But, like it or not, my little idea took off. So, by 2007, CD<br />
Baby had 200,000 musicians, 2 million customers, and 85 employees. It’s<br />
much bigger than I ever wanted it to be. It just kind of grew regardless,<br />
but I’ll get back to that later.  In 2008, I was feeling very done with<br />
it. I kind of felt it was like a finished painting, like I had no more brush<br />
strokes to add to it. So I decided to sell the company, which is something I<br />
thought I would never do. It’s very hard to let go of your baby. So I sold<br />
it for $22 million cash and then put all the cash into a charitable trust so<br />
all the money will go back to music education when I die. I just realized I<br />
didn’t really want it.  I wanted to just kind of complete the cycle. All<br />
of the money had come from musicians. I wanted it to all go back to musicians<br />
after I die.  So there’s my background.  Why are you listening? Well, I feel<br />
a little weird now that I’ve had this strange success that people want to<br />
know my opinions on things, because to me I feel a little bit like Forrest<br />
Gump. I am not a brilliant entrepreneur. I don’t know much about business<br />
really, but I stumbled into a bunch of things and kind of like Forrest Gump,<br />
I just said okay at the right time and some good stuff happened. But along<br />
the way in ten years of doing this I learned some interesting lessons,<br />
often the hard way, always from experience, so that’s what I’m going to<br />
try to compress into one short talk for you here. Okay?  Why are you doing<br />
what you’re doing? You have to start with why because most people don’t<br />
know what they’re doing. They imitate other people. They just go with the<br />
flow. They often pursue someone else’s idea of what they’re supposed to<br />
be doing. Say they read a book of a successful entrepreneur or they see a<br />
friend of the family or they watch the “Social Network”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>movie, or whatever, and they think, “I can do that,” and they try to<br />
pursue someone else’s dream.  For two years, when I was 20 years old,<br />
I worked at Warner Brothers. I was the guy in the tape room, in back. So<br />
often these famous rock star musicians would come into Warner Brothers for<br />
a meeting with the executives, but then they would kind of come hide out in<br />
my tape room for a bit to catch their breath before going in to meet with<br />
the suits. So I got to meet a lot of pretty miserable rock stars. I think<br />
it’s because a lot of them maybe set out on a certain trajectory. When<br />
they were 17, they had a dream that they wanted to be a rock star on stage,<br />
and by 25 they did it, they were a rock star and they got famous. At 35,<br />
they’re still doing it because that’s just all they knew, where they were<br />
on a certain trajectory, but it didn’t actually suit them anymore. They<br />
were pretty miserable. Or maybe when they got there, they realized that this<br />
isn’t what they really wanted. Maybe they just wanted fame, but they didn’t<br />
want to have a boss. Then maybe they sign a major record label deal and they<br />
realized they’ve got a boss.  So whatever it may be, I just found that you<br />
need to know why you’re doing what you’re doing, otherwise you’re just<br />
going to go on the wrong track for so long.  So the worst case scenario is<br />
you don’t want to end up with this death bed regret where at the end of<br />
your life you find that you’ve pursued something that someone convinced<br />
you you should want instead of what really works for you, and then you’re<br />
left with this horrible feeling of like, “No, what did I spend my life<br />
doing?” It like, “Well, you should have asked that earlier.” So let’s<br />
start with this. What do you want? Look at this list of things here: money,<br />
prestige, fame, leaving a legacy, or freedom. Whatever one or two appeals to<br />
you most, that’s fine. Just go for what totally appeals to you. No matter<br />
what you choose, somebody will always tell you that you’re wrong and that<br />
you should be doing it for other reasons, but you just need to be honest with<br />
yourself. Some people actually get really excited by money, and money is the<br />
real reason they’re doing things. Fine, if that’s what you’re into,<br />
just admit it. The key point is to know what it is and to focus on it and<br />
don’t defuse your energies trying to be everything to everyone and trying<br />
to make sure that nobody tells you you’re wrong because somebody’s always<br />
going to tell you you’re wrong.</p>
<p>So for example, if you know that money really excites you and you really<br />
want to make a lot of money, then fine, you can refuse fame. Let others<br />
take the spotlight and you can be one of the people that just focuses on<br />
the numbers. So I lived in Los Angeles for eight years and I met some movie<br />
stars. They’re out on the street and everywhere and I got to know some. The<br />
funny thing is it’s often surprising that they’re not as rich as you’d<br />
think they should be. But on the other hand, some of the richest people<br />
in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of because they made that<br />
decision early on that they’re going to stay behind the scenes, they’re<br />
going to make the money and let others kind of be in the spotlight, walk the<br />
red carpet, and all that kind of stuff. So, if you optimize your career for<br />
making money, you can make a lot more money by just admitting that early on,<br />
that you’ll let others take the fame, take the spotlight, leave a legacy,<br />
whatever. If you want to focus on money, just focus on money.  As another<br />
example, legacy. I lived in New York City for ten years. If you go around<br />
New York City, you see the word “Trump” everywhere. It’s like Trump<br />
Plaza, Trump Tower, Trump this, Trump whatever. I even drove two hours<br />
upstate into the countryside and saw the Donald J. Trump State Park, and<br />
I thought, “What’s with this guy? Why does he have such a need to put<br />
his name on everything? There have been plenty of real estate billionaires<br />
for centuries before him that didn’t have such a need to put their name<br />
on things. What’s with this guy?” But then I realized, like, “Okay,<br />
this is his measure. At a certain point, he must have decided that it’s<br />
important to him to put his name on things, which means that he’s decided<br />
to make less money by doing so, because if he just lets somebody else put<br />
their logo, whatever it may be, the Panasonic Building, he could have just<br />
let other people put their names on the building and he could have just been<br />
the owner. But no, he wanted his name on it, which is a decision to make less<br />
money, but more legacy.  On the other hand, you can optimize your life for<br />
freedom. This is the one that I chose. So I really liked the idea of setting<br />
up my life in a way that at any point I could just disappear or I could just<br />
be antisocial and go read books for a month or whatever it may be. So I had<br />
to set up my career in a certain way to delegate almost everything, make<br />
myself unnecessary to the day-to-day running of my company so that I was free</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>to go do other things. Of course, plenty of people along the way told me I<br />
was wrong, and they told me I could be making a lot more money if I were to do<br />
it this way, and that I needed to be more hands on, I needed to be more such<br />
and such. But I’d just say, “Okay, this is your measure.” My version of<br />
<span class="caps">DIY</span>, which is often known as Do It Yourself, I like the version that says,<br />
“Decide It Yourself.” Other people can do it. You’re the one that<br />
makes the decisions. You don’t have to do everything yourself. So that’s<br />
it. But whatever you choose, this is your compass. You need to optimize your<br />
activities based on what’s important to you, instead of defusing them.<br />
You might even get these side effects. You might be shooting for a career of<br />
fame. You might want to get as famous as possible, and you might make money<br />
as a side effect of doing this. Or you might be aiming for a life of freedom<br />
and you might get fame as a side effect of it, whatever it may be. But the<br />
important thing is to know your goal.  Nobody knows the future. I often speak<br />
at these conferences where there’s a panel of people and a moderator that<br />
says a question like, “What is the future of the music business?” The<br />
funny thing is, if there’s a guy who’s in the business of selling MP3s,<br />
he’ll pipe up and say, “The future of the music business is selling MP3s.<br />
We’ve got proof of this, and trust me everybody else is wrong, the future<br />
of the music business is selling MP3s.” And then if you have a guy over here<br />
whose business is, say, digital radio, he will tell you, “The future of the<br />
music business is digital radio. All these people are wrong. Nobody wants to<br />
buy MP3s. It’s digital radio. That’s what everybody wants.” The thing<br />
is nobody knows. Everybody is just kind of talking as if saying it enough<br />
will make it came true or spouting their corporate interest, but they’re<br />
all full of crap.  Nobody knows. If they would just admit that nobody knows<br />
or just have the courage to say, “I don’t know, nobody knows,” then we<br />
could start having a real intelligent conversation.  The funny thing with<br />
a lot of entrepreneurs is they put so much attention into this business<br />
plan. I think there’s a little bit of an unfair emphasis on this idea<br />
of doing the five-year projections and having people work out the numbers<br />
five years in advance and saying, “Well, what’s going to happen in four<br />
years? What’s going to happen then?” The problem is that your business</p>
<p>is mute because you don’t know. The reason that you can tell that business<br />
plans are always fiction is that all those numbers, those little bar graphs,<br />
they’re always going up, up, up, and not every business turns out like that.<br />
So if you admit that you don’t know, there’s this great saying. I think<br />
Steve Blank in California said this, “No business plan survives first<br />
contact with the customer.” I love this idea that no matter what you’ve<br />
got planned, once you get out in the real world, it’s all going to change.<br />
So my little example, with CD Baby, when I started this thing in 1997,<br />
I really thought it was going to be just a payment processor. Again, this<br />
is before PayPal existed, but that’s kind of what I had in mind. I got<br />
this credit card merchant account for myself and I was just going to let my<br />
friends use it and I would just charge a dollar or something like that for<br />
them to use it. So I made this little site. My first version of cdbaby.com<br />
was really just me and ten friends where I had their CDs there. Some guy<br />
from the Netherlands came in and bought a couple of CDs, shipped them to<br />
the Netherlands. Then a week later he came back and sent an email saying,<br />
“Hey, where are your new arrivals?” I said, “New arrivals?  What do you<br />
mean? Like, which of my friends am I now processing credit cards for? Why do<br />
you care?” He replied back saying, “Oh, I thought you were a store.  I’m<br />
sorry.” And I said, “Oh, a store, I’d never thought about that. Yeah,<br />
I could be a store.” So just like that my plan completely changed. I was<br />
like, “Yes, I’m going to make a store, cdbaby.com. It’ll be a store,<br />
awesome.” So for the next six years I did everything I could to try to make<br />
it the best little store I could.  Then in 2003, I get this email from Apple,<br />
just after they had launched the iTunes music store, inviting me up to their<br />
office to talk about getting the entire CD Baby catalogue up and selling in<br />
the iTunes music store. So I went into the Apple office and there was just<br />
a little room and I just assumed we were going to be talking to one of the<br />
marketing people or whatever, and Steve Jobs himself walks out. I was like,<br />
“Whoa, hi.” He went into full presentation mode, like, “We want to<br />
get every piece of music ever recorded up and selling in the iTunes music<br />
store. We want your entire catalogue, even the stuff that isn’t selling<br />
well, even the stuff that might be out of print. We want every piece of<br />
music ever recorded.” So all I really had to do was</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>say, “Okay.” I told you, Forrest Gump. I said, “Okay,” and now I’m<br />
a distributor. So just like that, our plan completely changed. Then CD Baby<br />
became one of the biggest distributors of independent digital music, into<br />
all of these big outlets, like Amazon and iTunes and Napster and Rhapsody,<br />
and all of those.  So if you just admit up front that nobody knows the<br />
future, you can actually plan accordingly. It means that you get into more<br />
of a listening mode so that you can look at a problem and think that it’s<br />
a worthy problem to solve and admit that you don’t know the answer, but<br />
you’re willing to try to find out, or continually try to find out the answer,<br />
as it will change through time. So if you get into this mindset, then you<br />
can ask questions more than answer questions. You can learn more instead of<br />
preach more. I just find it’s a better mindset to be in.  When I started<br />
CD Baby, when I decided it was a store, it really just did one thing. There<br />
were a list of CDs with a “Buy Now” button by them, and you could buy<br />
the CDs and I’d ship them to you. That was it. That was all it did. This<br />
was actually kind of fun, during the Dot Com boom. Everybody was saying,<br />
“We’ve got an entirely new business paradigm. This changes everything.<br />
This is nothing like the old school. Everything is different now. This time<br />
it’s different.” Everybody was talking revolution and how everything<br />
is going to be different now. People would often call up CD Baby saying,<br />
“Hey, a friend of mine told me about you. So, can you tell me what you<br />
do?” And I’d say, “We’re a record store.” Then they’d say,<br />
“And?” And I’d say, “We’re a record store.” And they’d say,<br />
“So, we upload music to you and you . . .” And I’d say, “No, no,<br />
no, no, we’re a record store.” And they say, “So you burn CDs onto<br />
. . .” And I’d say, “No, no, no, no, we’re a record store.” I’d<br />
say, “Have you ever been to a record store?” And they say, “Yes.”<br />
I’d say, “We’re a record store.” They go, “Oh, that’s it?”<br />
I’d say, “That’s it!” And they say, “Oh, okay. Cool.” The funny<br />
thing is that during all this kind of blah, blah, cloud, haze of the Dot<br />
Com revolution and everybody trying to do everything different, I think it<br />
actually really helped us kind of cut through the chaos by just saying,<br />
“We’re a record store.” It really made it easy for people to tell<br />
other people about us. If you just do one thing well, then friends can tell<br />
friends can tell friends, “Hey, you’ve got to check out this company,<br />
CD Baby.” ‘’What do they do?’ “They’re a record store.”</p>
<p>That’s it. No kind of “They are revolutionizing the 2.0 blah, blah,<br />
blah.” So, when I started this thing, of course like all of us, I had no<br />
idea what to charge for my service. So I went down to the local record store<br />
in Woodstock, New York, which is a tiny little thing, the size of someone’s<br />
bedroom. I think it was called Rhythms. Yeah, it was called Rhythms in<br />
Woodstock, New York, a tiny little place. On the checkout counter, along<br />
with all the other normal CDs, they had a few kind of local artists lined<br />
up in display cases on the checkout counter.  I asked the woman, “Hey,<br />
how does it work if I want to sell my CD here?” She said, “Well, you<br />
set the selling price at whatever you want. We just keep a flat $4 per CD<br />
sold. Then just come by every week, and we’ll pay you and show you who<br />
bought your CDs.” I said, “Okay. I can work with that.” So I went<br />
home to my brand new website and I typed, “You set the selling price<br />
at whatever you want. We keep a flat $4 per CD sold, and we pay you every<br />
week.” That was it. I just figured if it worked for her, it would work<br />
for me. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.  I added one more number,<br />
by the way, because it took me about 40 minutes of work to add a new album<br />
into the store, to scan the album art work, rip the audio clips off the CD,<br />
and then fix the spelling mistakes in people’s bios, and use Photoshop on<br />
the album art, and all that stuff. It took about 45 minutes. So I charged<br />
a $35 set up fee. That was it. Those two numbers, $35 set up and the $4<br />
per CD sold, is what took CD Baby all the way from zero profit up to $50<br />
million or something like that. But the funny thing is five years later,<br />
after starting this thing, where I didn’t really change anything, I was<br />
doing the exact same thing for five years, I was just a record store. Then<br />
I started getting this press once we were successful and people would write<br />
these articles saying, “It’s revolutionizing the music business. It’s<br />
a new revolution in the music business.” The funny thing is revolution is<br />
word that people only use when you’re successful. Before that, you’re<br />
just a quirky person who does things differently.  So the problem is, is<br />
that now we’re surrounded by all these businesses screaming revolution,<br />
and if you want to start your own company, it’s so tempting to think that<br />
you have to be screaming revolution too or that you have to come up with<br />
something so revolutionary. The problem is that if you think that love needs to</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>look like Romeo and Juliet, meaning, if people aren’t drinking poison and<br />
stabbing themselves in balconies at midnight, and tombs and monks and all that<br />
kind of stuff, if you think that anything less than that is not true love,<br />
then you’ll miss out on what could be an amazing relationship that grows<br />
slowly. If you think that revolution needs to be war and blood and disruption,<br />
and disrupted industries and industries collapsing, and businesses collapsing<br />
and businesses growing out of the rubble, if you think that everything<br />
needs to look like that, you’ll overlook the simple idea that just helps<br />
people better.  So what I think people call revolution later, when successful,<br />
at the time just kind of feels like uncommon sense. It’s when you look at a<br />
situation and it seems pretty obvious that it could be done in a very different<br />
way than everybody’s doing it and it makes a lot more sense to do things<br />
that way, but for some reason people aren’t. So that’s it. If you persist<br />
with that and it’s successful, they’ll say that you made a revolution.<br />
If it’s not a hit, switch. Before I started CD Baby, I spent 12 years as a<br />
professional musician doing lots of different things. I had a recording studio<br />
and I was producing people’s records. I was playing on people’s records.<br />
I was in a circus for ten years. I tried starting a booking agency. I tried<br />
running a five-piece Funk band, a two-piece coffee house duo, a two-piece<br />
thing called the Professional Pests, where I was running around inside a black<br />
costume. I did my solo show. I tried a lot of stuff. I even did a record label,<br />
Artificial Records.  It was kind of fun. But nothing really went very well.<br />
Everything I was doing for 12 years felt like a ridiculous amount of work just<br />
to get anywhere. It felt like I was always fighting uphill battles against<br />
locks and slamming doors. Nothing was easy. Everything was hard. But then<br />
I started CD Baby, and it was this little hobby, like I said, and it just<br />
took off all of as sudden. It wasn’t’ like I wasn’t like I was trying<br />
to build the business. I wasn’t trying to fight any uphill battles. It<br />
was like everything was rolling downhill. It was more about just managing<br />
the growth. More and more people kept coming my way, and all I was doing is<br />
just saying yes.  So it felt a little bit like writing a hit song. Here’s<br />
what I mean by that. For many years as a song writer I would read interviews<br />
with hit song writers. A lot of them would say that they’re big hit song<br />
that everybody knows was really just a little throw away song.</p>
<p>Say, they had finished recording the entire album, and then there was this one<br />
goofy little song that they were just singing on the tour bus or something,<br />
and the producer said, “Come on, let’s hit record on that song. It can’t<br />
hurt.” And the band didn’t want to, but then they said, “All right,<br />
all right.” They hit record and that becomes the number one hit. These<br />
song writers are often stunned by this, saying like, “I wrote 100 songs<br />
and who knows why that one is more successful.” Sometimes it’s due to<br />
circumstances totally out of their control, like this one song that they<br />
wrote years ago suddenly was heard by somebody who does the music for a TV<br />
show and it was the season finale in the closing credits and now they wanted<br />
to use their song, and all of a sudden that’s a big hit song.  But the<br />
lesson learned is that looking back at my previous 12 years and all of the<br />
stuff I did that was so difficult, I think my advice for my younger self,<br />
and therefore for you, is that I was doing lots of things that people just<br />
weren’t into and now I felt the difference. When you do something that<br />
people are really into, you’ll know it because you get this reaction, like<br />
people go, “Oh my God, Yes, I love this. Can I pay you for this? I want<br />
to be your first costumer.” People are actually opening up their wallets<br />
to pay you because they are so excited about what you’re doing. It feels<br />
effortless. But on the other hand, when you get this kind of lukewarm response<br />
from people, like even if say you are have a business idea and you tell people<br />
and they go, “Yeah, sound s pretty good. Let me know if it happens.”<br />
That’s kind of a polite no. That doesn’t mean they’re interested.  So,<br />
now that I felt the difference between the two, my lesson for myself and you,<br />
is that when you’re spending time on these ideas that people just aren’t<br />
into, let it go.  If people aren’t into it, stop and do something else.<br />
Another song writer comparison, I spent a lot of years in L.A. and New York,<br />
and some in Nashville, where you would see some song writers who wrote one<br />
song, maybe it was the first song they every wrote or maybe it was a song<br />
they wrote for their wife or something like that, but they get obsessed with<br />
this one song and they spend years trying to bring this one song around the<br />
music industry and nobody’s into it. They try to keep pushing this one<br />
song. It always felt really kind of pathetic that people just kept pushing<br />
this one song that people aren’t into. Whereas, on the other hand,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>most successful song writers seem to just churn them out. It’s like<br />
every week they’re writing the best song they can, at the time, and they<br />
just keep going. So if somebody’s not into the song they wrote last week,<br />
whatever, there’s more.  So my advice for entrepreneurs is to be more like<br />
those kinds of song writers. Hopefully you have other ideas.  Of course you<br />
have other ideas. So keep pushing these other ideas, I’m sorry. Meaning<br />
if you’re doing something that people just aren’t into, let it go and<br />
just try something else. Don’t be like these song writers that just push<br />
one song that people aren’t into.  There’s this great quote from Warren<br />
Buffett, the investor. He said that in all the years and all the different<br />
investment opportunities that passed through the desk, and of course<br />
they all passed through his desk, he said, “We never invest in anything<br />
unless it feels like a real homerun.” So, I think that you have lots of<br />
business ideas, try them out, but don’t get too stuck on any one unless<br />
you can tell like it’s a real homerun, and everybody’s really into it.<br />
So if people aren’t loving what you’re doing, stop. Don’t persist,<br />
don’t push it. When you’ve got something great, you’ll know. People<br />
will be freaking out over it.  If people say anything less than, “Oh,<br />
my God. Yes, I want to pay for this,” then stop and write a new song.<br />
The lesson learned the hard way is that success comes from persistently<br />
improving and inventing, not from persistently pushing what’s not working.<br />
Version 0.1 I was at a music conference and met somebody where I said, “So,<br />
what are you doing? What are you working on?” And he said, “I am making<br />
the ultimate music recommendation engine. This thing is going to be the total<br />
enterprise solution that’s going to tie into every piece of music you’ve<br />
ever listened to, everything you’ve ever bought, ever concert you’ve<br />
ever gone to, everything in your entire hard drive, and then it’s going<br />
to connect to all of your friends through all of your social networks and<br />
everything they are listening to and every concert they’ve ever been to,<br />
and everything, whatever.” He said, “The only problem is I’ve been<br />
trying for two years to raise the $2 million it’s going to take to make<br />
this thing. So hey, do you know any</p>
<p>investors?” I said, “Look, what kind of music would I like?” And<br />
he said, “What do you mean?” I said, “You said you want to make<br />
a music recommendation service, right? So what kind of music would I<br />
like?” And he said, “No, no, man, you don’t understand. This is<br />
business-to-business. This is enterprise. This is going to be big. This<br />
isn’t just like recommending music to a person. This is like a total<br />
backend solution.” I was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The problem is<br />
that what you’re describing here is like everything you ever wanted to be<br />
someday. You know how software has version numbers, right? Like Version 1.0,<br />
then 2.0 comes out, then 2.5, then Version 3.5. So what you’ve just described<br />
here is Version Infinity. That’s like everything it will ever be, someday in<br />
the glorious future if everything turns out perfectly. But long before that,<br />
you’ve got to start back here at Version 0.1. Version 0.1 is the thing<br />
that you can do right now, this week, today, with no programming, no nothing,<br />
but you can do it now. Then you can make just incremental improvements from<br />
that.” So I said, “In your case, why don’t you just recommend a song<br />
to somebody or recommend an artist? So you can just turn to anybody here<br />
at this conference and say, ‘Hey, what kind of music do you like?’<br />
And they’d say, ‘I like Bjork.’ And you could say, ‘Okay, Bjork.<br />
What’s your name?’ Write it down. ‘Have you heard Lykke Li?’ ‘No, I<br />
haven’t.’ ‘Okay, go listen to Lykke Li and tell me what you think.’”<br />
There, you’ve now just made a music recommendation service. Eventually this<br />
piece of paper fills up with people you’ve recommended music to and maybe<br />
they get back to you and tell you what they think. Eventually you could put<br />
that into a spreadsheet. Eventually you could put your spreadsheet onto a<br />
computer. Online eventually people could log into their account and asks for<br />
recommendations without calling you. Whatever. It sounds so small potatoes,<br />
but that’s kind of the point. So instead of just spending two years trying<br />
to raise money to do this giant enterprise thing, you can just start and<br />
most importantly, you can start talking to real people that need this thing,<br />
or not. Then you can know early on whether they need it or not. Then you can<br />
start to get their feedback for what they want this service to be.’ So in<br />
my little example at CD Baby, the first version of CD Baby did nothing. It<br />
was just a list of CDs, each one with a little “Add to Cart” button that<br />
would bring</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>you to one of those forms that asks your name, and address, and credit card<br />
info. My little security secret, by the way, is that for the whole first year,<br />
all that form did is email me the info. That’s it. I didn’t even have any<br />
fancy server side, backend processing. It just sent me an email with all the<br />
info. But I would receive each email, and it was only a few a week. I’d<br />
highlight my mouse over the name, Ctrl C, Alt-Tab-Ctrl V, and I’d paste<br />
it into a little form to print out the mailing label, and I think a File<br />
Maker Pro database on my computer, and that’s it. That’s all it did for<br />
the whole first year, was that. But that was enough to get me profitable<br />
in the second month of business. I think I made something like $100,000 by<br />
the end of the year, just with that, no programmers, no software, nothing,<br />
but it was enough to get going, to be in the game.  There’s a great quote,<br />
I think it’s from Reid Hoffman.  He says, “If you’re not launching too<br />
soon, you’re launching too late.” Or maybe the quote is something like,<br />
“If you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you’ve launched too<br />
late.” The whole point is, Version 0.1, the thing that you can do right now<br />
to get started.  You just need this confidence to know that this big massive<br />
vision you have for your massive business, it can happen someday, but you have<br />
to start now instead of just kind of sitting around trying to raise money and<br />
hoping that that might happen someday.  Ideas versus execution. A friend of<br />
mine said, “Hey, I met this really good entrepreneur. I really want you<br />
to meet him. He’s got a really good idea. He’s got a really brilliant<br />
business idea, and he wants to run it by you. I told him I’d introduce<br />
you.” So I said, “All right, all right.” He CC’d me on the email<br />
so now it was too late for me to say no. So I met with this guy and said,<br />
“Okay. What’s your idea?” And he said, “Well, I’ve got this killer<br />
idea. This is like a billion dollar idea. This is huge! But I need you to<br />
sign this non-disclosure agreement first because really it’s a billion<br />
dollar idea. If you hear this idea you’ll see, it’s massive. This is<br />
huge, so you need to sign this non-disclosure agreement before I tell you my<br />
idea.” So ordinarily I wouldn’t do this, but we have this mutual friend<br />
and a I was on the spot socially. So, I was like, “All right. There you<br />
go. Here’s your non-disclosure agreement. What’s this great idea?” He<br />
said, “Okay. You ready? Online dating with music.” And I went, “Yeah?”<br />
And he said, “That’s it. It’s online dating with music. This could be<br />
huge! This is like a billion dollar idea, man! So I just figured if you</p>
<p>can make it, like if you could just program this thing up, you get the website<br />
going, you just get it happening, get some people to run this thing. I’m<br />
the idea guy so we’ll go 50/50 on this since I came up with the idea and<br />
you make it happen.” And I said, “Wait. Is there any more to it than<br />
this? Do you have any details, any plan for how this is going to work?”<br />
And he said, “Dude, online dating with music, duh. This is huge.” I said,<br />
“Okay. Hold on. We’ve got to back up here. You’re missing the point on<br />
something.” I said, “Let me draw you a little chart.” And I grabbed<br />
a pen and a piece of paper and I said, “Okay. Let’s say that give a<br />
value to the worth of an idea. Let’s put bad ideas as -1, an average idea,<br />
we’ll give it a 5, great ideas, let’s give it a 15, and an amazing idea,<br />
let’s give it a 20. Okay?” “Now, execution, no execution, let’s give<br />
it a value of $1, average execution, a value of $10,000, good execution<br />
$100,000, and amazing execution, a value of $10 million. The point is to<br />
make a business you need to multiply the two. So your amazing idea with no<br />
execution, that’s not worth a billion dollars, that’s worth $20 because<br />
you haven’t done anything about it. Without doing anything, it’s just<br />
$20. I’ll pay for the cokes that we’re drinking right now. Now, if you<br />
have even a good idea with good execution, you could maybe make a million<br />
dollars. If you have an amazing idea with great execution, you could make<br />
$20 million. But ideas on their own are just a multiplier. They’re worth<br />
nothing without the execution.” So that’s why when people who always want<br />
to tell me their business idea, I just say, “I don’t want to hear the<br />
idea. I just want to see the execution. That’s where the real value is.”<br />
Okay. Last section – the most successful things we did at CD Baby. It would<br />
be wrong of me to just start blathering on in these big moralistic, vague,<br />
preachy things and not give some real specifics. So these are the things that<br />
in ten years of running CD Baby and going to lots of conferences and stuff,<br />
I would speak to lots of musicians and, more importantly, I would often<br />
overhear musicians telling other musicians why they use CD Baby or why they<br />
should use CD Baby. So I’d get to hear what things people had on the top<br />
of their mind.  It’s like the main reasons they love CD Baby and would tell<br />
their friends to use it.  So here they are. Number One, we answered the phone</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>on the second ring. You wouldn’t believe how huge this is. I think it was<br />
the number one, most common reason I heard for why musicians would tell<br />
other musicians that they should use CD Baby. They said, “They pick up<br />
their phone. You can call them.” They said, “Dude, I sent my CDs and I<br />
just picked up the phone and called them, asked if they’d arrived, and they<br />
answer on the second ring and they say, ‘CD Baby.’ There’s no voicemail<br />
system.” Somebody else would say, “Yeah, I was passing through Portland,<br />
Oregon, and just realized that hey, CD Baby’s in Portland. So I just called<br />
them and said, ‘Can I come by?’ and they picked up the phone and said,<br />
‘Sure, come on by.’ These guys are awesome, you can reach them. You can<br />
talk to a real person.” So, I think this is so important because I believe<br />
that you should treat your customers the way that you treat your friends. When<br />
your friends call you, you don’t put them through some seven layer voicemail<br />
system, “Press 7 to reach so and so.” You pick up the phone and you say<br />
hello. So if you want to treat your customers the way that you treat your<br />
friends, pick up the phone. You wouldn’t believe what a huge competitive<br />
advantage this was. For example, I think a few years after I started CD<br />
Baby, there was some big Dot Com funded company. I think they were called<br />
Riffage. They were doing almost the exact same thing as CD Baby, and <span class="caps">AOL</span> had<br />
given them $25 million of investment and I thought, “Oh my God, my little<br />
hobby, time to shut down now.” And then Amazon even did the same thing as<br />
CD Baby does. They opened their Advantage Program and made it so that any<br />
musician could send their CDs in directly to Amazon. So I thought, “Okay,<br />
there’s no way somebody’s going to use my little service run out of my<br />
home.” But no, this one main competitive advantage that I pick up the phone<br />
was so massive that people trusted CD Baby where they didn’t trust other<br />
companies. Huge.  Next one, personalized email headers, tiny but huge. In<br />
the little <span class="caps">PHP</span> programming code, in the place where any outgoing emails are<br />
sent, I noticed that at the moment that you’re sending the “To” email<br />
address and the name of the person it’s going to, that’s the same place<br />
where you set the “From”, saying it’s from CD Baby. So for the first<br />
year or two all outgoing emails just said it was from CD Baby. But then,<br />
just as a lark one day, I decided to add just two lines of programming code<br />
so that I set the “From” address to use the</p>
<p>first name of the person we were emailing. So if your name is Sarah and we were<br />
emailing you, it would say that the email was from CD Baby loves Sarah. If your<br />
name was Marcus and we were emailing you, then it would say, “CD Baby loves<br />
Marcus.” People loved this.  People would often reply going, “’Are you<br />
seriously going in and adjusting your Outlook settings every time you’re<br />
contacting me? You people are freaking.” And then they would forward the<br />
email to their friends just to talk about it and that’s the whole point. It<br />
was so remarkable and different and weird, and also kind of humanizing in<br />
acknowledging them as an individual, that it just kind of stood out. So,<br />
a tiny little thing that you can do.  The next one, changes need pizza. This<br />
was one of my favorites. So I told you that it would take about 45 minutes to<br />
set up a new album at CD Baby when somebody would mail it in. Every now and<br />
then somebody would mail in an album, we’d do all the 45 minutes of work,<br />
and we’d put it live on the website. Then about a week later somebody would<br />
reply back, going, “Eh, now I’m looking at it, I don’t think, you know,<br />
do you think maybe you could adjust it? I want the album facing this way now,<br />
and I think I want to use different clips in a different order.” I think<br />
you could actually hear their voice talking like that, “Eh, yeah, eh.”<br />
I know the feeling. I put out my own album. I know that sometimes it’s not<br />
until you see something in a public place that you notice some more mistakes<br />
or things you want to change.  So I totally understood creatively, but it<br />
also would take a lot of work for me to do all this stuff all over again. So<br />
early on, I just kind of took a chance and told somebody on the phone that<br />
was requesting these things once, I said, “Sure, I’d be glad to do it,<br />
but you’ve got to send a pizza.” And they say, “Huh?” I’d say,<br />
“Look. The local pizzeria, here’s their phone number.  They take credit<br />
cards over the phone and they already know where CD Baby is. In fact, they<br />
already know our favorite pizza. So because this is going to take like 45<br />
minutes of extra work, you just order a pizza and we’ll be glad to do any<br />
changes you want.” They would think I was kidding, right? I’d say, “No,<br />
I’m serious. I just want you to acknowledge that it takes a lot of extra<br />
work to do this and there’s a real person here who has to do this work. So<br />
we’d be glad to do anything you want, just get a pizza.” People would<br />
often, again, it’s like at conferences when I’d hear musicians telling</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>other musicians about CD Baby, they’d use this example. They’d say,<br />
“Dude, there’s this great company. It’s CD Baby and they’re awesome,<br />
and you know what?  I had to make a change to my album once. They told me I<br />
had to order a pizza to make the change. Isn’t that awesome?” I think the<br />
whole point is, if I step back and dissect it, it’s that it was humanizing<br />
it. Too often people set up businesses and they almost try to dehumanize<br />
everything. They say “we” instead of “I.” And they say, “Dear<br />
Customer 43625,” and they use boiler plate legalese to kind of cover their<br />
ass and do everything to appear to not be human. They don’t want to admit<br />
that it’s real people there. So this is doing the opposite. It’s just<br />
reminding customers that it’s just real people on the other side. That,<br />
yes, there’s a website, but it’s like a real person here doing work and<br />
scanning your album artwork and fixing your spelling of your bio, and whatever<br />
that is. So I think anything you can do in your company that humanizes it,<br />
that reminds the customers that it’s just real people on the other end, is<br />
huge and wins all kinds of love and affection and loyalty that now they can<br />
relate to you.  Next one, customer comments sent to musician. So at the end of<br />
each order, I’d have a place that would ask the customer, “Where did you<br />
hear of this artist?  Please, just take a second and tell us where you heard of<br />
this artist, and we’ll forward your comments to the musicians.” So people<br />
would write things like, “Oh, I was in Santa Monica and saw you playing on<br />
the Third Street Promenade. Then I went home to Yahoo and searched for you and<br />
love your music.” Or, “I heard your music on <span class="caps">KEXP</span> Radio, sounds awesome,<br />
went a searched Google and found you. Love your music.” So many times over<br />
the years musicians would tell me that some big breakthrough success they had,<br />
like whether it was getting their music on a TV show or booking a European<br />
tour, all started with one of these little comments. Like just introducing<br />
the customer to the musician and getting that two-way dialogue going was<br />
huge. Again, it’s like this great competitive advantage that CD Baby had<br />
over all of the other businesses doing something similar because they were<br />
trying to hold on to their customer data, “As it’s proprietary that nobody<br />
must know this is ours.” But in my mind, it’s like the customers were<br />
just using CD Baby to get at the musician. It’s really the musician’s<br />
customer. I’m just the middle man, like, “Let’s remember our place</p>
<p>here.” Next one, special requests with an order. The last thing at the<br />
end of an order would say, “Any special requests, just let us know.” I<br />
think it said in parentheses, “Yes, anything.” There would just be a big<br />
text area box there where you could type anything and most people didn’t.<br />
But every now and then people would just experiment.  So one guy said, “I<br />
would love some cinnamon gum.” That’s all he said. One of my guys in the<br />
warehouse just happened to be making a run to the store when he got to that<br />
order that he was packing. So he left it on his packing table, went out to the<br />
store anyway, and while he was there, he picked up some cinnamon gum, dropped<br />
it in the box with the guy’s order. The guy gets his CDs in the mail, opens<br />
it up, and there’s some cinnamon gum. He’s like, “Oh my God.” He writes<br />
a blog article about it. He tells all of his friends about it. Word of mouth,<br />
huge. I’ll bet a thousand people heard of CD Baby because of this one guy<br />
that got the cinnamon gum in the mail.  But even better, there’s a great<br />
story out there. I linked to it on my site. If you go to Sivers.org/squid,<br />
there’s a great YouTube video, where I think the story goes that, the guy<br />
had bought a CD or was buying a CD from CD Baby where the album cover was<br />
somebody with a squid on their head. So when he got to the box that said,<br />
“Any special requests,” he said, “Yes, I would actually like a plastic<br />
or a rubber squid, and if you don’t have a plastic one, a real squid<br />
would do. Thank you very much.” He just wrote this comment to be funny.<br />
But what he didn’t know is that in the warehouse we had recently received<br />
a box of CDs from a guy in Korea. The guy in Korea had included some shrink<br />
wrapped squid as a gift to CD Baby along with his CDs. Maybe it was instead<br />
of pizza. Maybe he needed a change made to his album. So in the warehouse, the<br />
guys had this squid tacked up on the wall for the longest time in its plastic<br />
wrapping still. So when we got this order, they said, “All right. We can<br />
finally use the squid.” So they included the squid, a real squid, in the<br />
order with the CDs. When the guy got his CDs, he was so blown away that he<br />
went onto YouTube and made video of him telling the whole five minute story<br />
of his order at CD Baby. The thing has had thousands of views by now. So<br />
thousands of people hearing about CD Baby all because one of the brilliant<br />
guys in the warehouse included a squid in the order. I love that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>So, the point of all these little stories is that people will remember you<br />
more for all the little ways you make them smile than all the other kind of<br />
business school, <span class="caps">MBA</span>, planning, five-year business plan kind of stuff you<br />
do. Never forget that all that foundation stuff is important. The numbers<br />
are very important of course.  But if you just find these little tiny ways<br />
to make people smile, it just means so much more to them than all that<br />
other stuff. It’ll be like the thing that makes your business and breaks<br />
the rest.  So I’ve been living in Singapore for a while now and I’m<br />
often giving this talk here in Asia. People kind of look at me and go, “Oh,<br />
yeah, you eccentric Americans, you’re kind of weird like that.” But no,<br />
that’s the whole point, is all these things are eccentric in America too<br />
and that’s the whole point. It’s finding the unusual thing to do. It<br />
would be the thing that makes uncommon sense. It’s not trying to make your<br />
business like everybody else. It’s trying to always make your business<br />
not like any others and do the things that nobody else will do. Especially<br />
if you’re a small business, you have all this wonderful advantage that you<br />
can just do things because you want to not because it impresses the board of<br />
directors. So, these unusual things are so remarkable that everybody tells<br />
their friends about you. You can be shockingly unique and use uncommon sense.<br />
That’s it. I hope this was useful. I hope I can stop talking into a video<br />
camera now. Email me anytime at derrick@sivers.org. Some of the coolest people<br />
I’ve met are the ones who have emailed me out of the blue. So, please, feel<br />
free to email and ask any questions or say hi, and I hope this helps. Thanks.</p>
