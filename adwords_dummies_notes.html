   <p>= Adwords dummies =============</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market</p>
<p>Glenn boils down initial market research into one key question: “Are other<br />
people making money there?”</p>
<p>== Google keyword tool</p>
<p>Use Google’s Keyword Tool (here’s a shortcut: www.askhowie.com/kwtool)<br />
to discover the popularity of the search terms in your market. When you navi-<br />
gate to the Keyword Tool shortcut, here’s all you have to do:<br />
1. Tell Google what language and geographic location you’re curious<br />
about by clicking Edit link next to the default options.<br />
2. Make sure the Descriptive Words or Phrases radio button is selected.<br />
3. Type your main keyword into the search box.<br />
4. Deselect the Use Synonyms option.<br />
You’ll want to include synonyms as you build your keyword empire, but<br />
right now, focus on the main keyword family.<br />
5. Type the squiggly characters into the box below to prove you’re a<br />
human.<br />
6. Click the Get Keyword Ideas button.</p>
<p>Download <span class="caps">CSV</span></p>
<p>✓ Which keywords are more popular (higher on the list) than others?<br />
✓ Are there just a few keywords that result in the vast majority of<br />
searches?<br />
✓ Do some of the keywords represent sub-markets within the main market<br />
(for example, rabbits for hobbyists versus rabbits for commercial<br />
purposes — pets or meat)?</p>
<p>The total number of searches for these keywords, which you can calculate<br />
in Excel by selecting the cell below the final entry in the Approx Avg Search<br />
Column and hitting the Autosum button (∑) in the Standard toolbar, is a good<br />
indication of whether it’s a good market to enter.</p>
<p>== Sizing up the entire market by tallying total advertising spent</p>
<p>1. Go to www.askhowie.com/mpg and download the <span class="caps">MPG</span> Calculator.<br />
(I ask for your name and e-mail address in exchange — see Chapter 11<br />
to discover my strategy.)<br />
You’ll need Microsoft Excel or the free spreadsheet Calc available at<br />
www.openoffice.org to open the <span class="caps">MPG</span>.<br />
2. After you’ve downloaded and opened the <span class="caps">MPG</span>, enter the keyword<br />
you searched using the free Keyword Tool.<br />
I describe this tool in the “Determining market size by spying on<br />
searches” section, earlier in this chapter.<br />
3. Enter the total monthly search volume from the spreadsheet with the<br />
top 100 keywords into the <span class="caps">MSV</span> column of the <span class="caps">MPG</span>.<br />
4. Log in to your account at http://google.com/adwords.<br />
5. Click the Tools link and choose Traffic Estimator from the Optimize<br />
Your Ads section.<br />
6. From the keyword spreadsheet, select and copy the entire column<br />
containing the keywords.<br />
Do not include the search volume numbers, just the keywords themselves.<br />
7. Paste those keywords into the box at the top of the Traffic Estimator.<br />
8. Leave Max <span class="caps">CPC</span> and Daily Budget blank, select the language and<br />
location targeting based on the market you’re going after, and click<br />
Continue.<br />
9. Sort the results by Search Volume by clicking the Search Volume<br />
column header. Look at the Average <span class="caps">CPC</span> for the most searched<br />
keywords.<br />
This is Google’s estimate of the cost of showing your ad in positions 1–3.<br />
10. Divide the Average <span class="caps">CPC</span> in half and enter that number in the<br />
Maximum <span class="caps">CPC</span> field. Click Get New Estimates.<br />
11. Again, sort the keyword list by Search Volume. Keep reducing your<br />
Maximum <span class="caps">CPC</span> until the Estimated Ad Positions are 4–6 for the major-<br />
ity of your highest volume keywords.<br />
(Keep sorting by Search Volume after each iteration.)<br />
12. Now take the Average <span class="caps">CPC</span> estimated by Google and paste it into the<br />
<span class="caps">CPC</span> column of the <span class="caps">MPG</span>.</p>
<p>AdWords beginners should enter niche markets with TMHs between 100 and<br />
200. At 200, the markets become more competitive, and below 100, there’s<br />
not enough money to go around.</p>
<p>Visit Google Trends (www.google.com/trends) and search for the major<br />
keywords in your market. Is the traffic stable over the past few years?<br />
Trending upward? Good. If it’s trending downward, beware.</p>
<p>== Taking the Temperature of Your Market — Advanced Methods</p>
<p>Go to www.google.com, search for your keyword, and count the number<br />
of sponsored listings. You can do this by clicking More Sponsored Links just<br />
below the column of AdWords ads on the right</p>
<p>Glenn Livingston (www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com) cautions<br />
AdWords beginners to avoid competing on keywords with more than 25 com-<br />
petitors</p>
<p>A simple way to establish bid persistence is to print the first two pages of the<br />
sponsored listings and then print the listings again at least three weeks later.<br />
To reduce your risk as much as possible, repeat this exercise again three<br />
weeks after that. If you see that the listings are stable over those six weeks,<br />
these folks are either very careless or they’re making money.</p>
<p>To use the AdWords Keyword Tool within your account, follow these steps:<br />
1. Log in to your AdWords account, click the Tools tab, and then select<br />
Keyword tool from the drop-down list.<br />
2. Enter your main keyword and enter click the Get Keyword Ideas<br />
button.<br />
3. In the Choose Columns to Display drop-down menu, select Show<br />
Estimated Avg. <span class="caps">CPC</span> and Show Estimated Ad Position.</p>
<p>You’re looking for a sweet spot, where the Max <span class="caps">CPC</span> is low enough<br />
that you can afford to pay for enough clicks to test and improve — and high<br />
enough that you can be sure others are making money in this market.</p>
<p>Paypal makes its shop sales data available. See www.askhowie.com/paypalshops</p>
<p>Spend some time looking at which merchants are making the most — and<br />
fewest — sales.</p>
<p>Search Amazon sales anonymously. A keyword search is ordered by number of sales.</p>
<p>&#8594; Are people making money online in this market using <span class="caps">PPC</span>?</p>
<p>== Find out where your customers hang out online</p>
<p>Find out who your target market is first!</p>
<p>http://groups.yahoo.com.<br />
Google groups<br />
Forums</p>
<p>Blog search<br />
www.technorati.com<br />
google blog search<br />
<span class="caps">RSS</span> feed search</p>
<p>Build a list of bloggers &#8211; perfect for a VA.</p>
<p>You should filter the blog results by authority (a measure of how many other blogs<br />
link to that blog) to weed out insignificant blogs.</p>
<p>==- top AdWords advertisers in your market three times over six week</p>
<p>look at your competitor’s Web site as if you’re a potential customer. Can<br />
you find what you’re looking for? Does the site confuse or bore you? Is it easy<br />
to contact the site owner and ask questions? Do you trust the site? Can you<br />
order easily?</p>
<p>Pay attention to how that landing page connects to the rest of the site.<br />
Does it try to make a sale or to capture your contact information? What are<br />
the featured products? What are its shipping and return policies?</p>
<p>Find inbound links (Yahoo is better)</p>
<p>A high number of inbound links helps increase their organic Google traffic — as well as<br />
decrease their <span class="caps">PPC</span> bid prices by increasing quality score.</p>
<p>Do they send e-mail offers for additional products? Do they give coupon<br />
codes for dollars off? Do they request feedback? Do they ship promptly? Does<br />
the merchandise do what they say it does?</p>
<p>Your competitors are also your best potential business partners.</p>
<p>If you can figure out how to share customers, everyone can<br />
increase profits by promoting different offers to different market segments.<br />
You can play nice with competitors only when you can figure out ways to dif-<br />
ferentiate yourself from them.</p>
<p>== Positioning</p>
<p>If it’s not crystal clear why your offer is unique, it will be added to the<br />
rummage sale pile in their minds where all the other products go that they<br />
don’t quite understand and will probably never buy.</p>
<p>You want your offer to occupy a completely unique place in the cubbyhole system <br />
of your prospect’s mind and you want to figure out how to telegraph that unique <br />
value in seconds.</p>
<p>Marketing is &#8230; where your offer fits in the market space and why you’re uniquely qualified <br />
to hold a place in it, then communicating that message simply and powerfully,<br />
over and over again.</p>

<p>Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords</p>
<p>The practice of market empathy is one of the hardest marketing tasks you’ll<br />
ever have to accomplish.</p>
<p>Broad match<br />
Broad match keywords show your ad when the actual keyword is similar to<br />
yours. Buddha statue shows for the following actual searches (note the dif-<br />
ferences in spelling and capitalization):<br />
✓ Buddha statue<br />
✓ statue of the Buddha<br />
✓ Buddah statue<br />
✓ Korean statue of buddha<br />
✓ Buddhist statues</p>
<p>Phrase match<br />
Putting the broad match in double quotes converts it to phrase match, mean-<br />
ing the characters between the quotes must appear exactly as they are<br />
somewhere in the actual search. “Buddha statue” matches the following<br />
searches:<br />
✓ Buddha statue<br />
✓ “Buddha Statue”<br />
✓ Chinese Buddha statue<br />
✓ grinning Buddha statue<br />
Phrase matches generally have higher <span class="caps">CTR</span> and lower <span class="caps">CPC</span> (cost-per-click)<br />
than broad matches because they eliminate synonyms and changes in tense,</p>
<p>Exact match<br />
You indicate an exact match with square brackets, generally found to the<br />
right of the P key on your keyboard. [Buddha statue] will show only for<br />
the following searches:<br />
✓ Buddha statue<br />
✓ buddha Statue<br />
✓ “Buddha statue”</p>
<p>By monitoring the actual phrases that trigger visits to your site (via the<br />
Search Query Report), you eventually can eliminate many irrelevant searches<br />
by choosing only the keywords that qualified prospects are typing.</p>
<p>Online Thesaurus<br />
Go to http://thesaurus.reference.com to access the online version of<br />
Roget’s New MillenniumTM Thesaurus</p>
<p>For your purposes, the majority of thesaurus results are irrelevant. Look for<br />
words that jog your brain into thinking, “Oh, that’s a good keyword, too.”</p>
<p>Quintura.com is a visual thesaurus that shows you, at a glance, the major<br />
themes in a market.</p>
<p>Google’s Wonder Wheel is a visual representation of related searches that<br />
shows you, at a glance, the major themes in a market. Access the Wonder<br />
Wheel by performing a regular Google search, then clicking the Show Options<br />
link just below the search box. From the left navigation, select Wonder Wheel.</p>
<p>Google’s Related Searches</p>
<p>www.keywordspy.com</p>
<p>if your competitor has done a good job of researching key-<br />
words, you can use this sneaky tool to take advantage of all their hours of<br />
hard work. If you need to compete against established competitors in an<br />
AdWords market, this tool is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Server logs (where are they on Shopify?)</p>
<p>Select Misspelled keywords (or variations on keyword)<br />
✓ Significantly decreased competition: <br />
✓ Lower <span class="caps">CPC</span></p>
<p>If you sell 20 different colors or shapes or sizes or types of a product, be sure<br />
to include all those variables in your keyword list.</p>
<p>A regular verb and a gerund (the verb with <del>ing at the end) can signify com</del><br />
pletely different mindsets. Until you’re sure you don’t want the customer with<br />
a particular mindset, include them all.</p>
<p>Singular &amp; plural<br />
If the plural keyword is significantly cheaper to bid on than the singular, you<br />
know that other advertisers have found it harder to make money from the<br />
less-expensive keyword. If you optimize your sales process to bring the infor-<br />
mation-seeker to the point of purchase, you can take advantage of the cheap,<br />
plentiful “pre-transaction” keywords such as general plural terms.</p>
<p>Bid on domain names! This could be <span class="caps">HUGE</span>!<br />
you can snag some inexpensive traffic by bidding on (say) redfloodlights.com.</p>
<p>generate thousands of “sneaky” keyword variations from a single keyword.<br />
www.loweryourbidprice.com (potential app)</p>
<p>substitute synonyms with the click of a button, you can add hundreds of mis-<br />
spellings, convert singular to plural and vice versa, add .com to the end of<br />
your keyword, and add quotes and brackets automatically</p>
<p>== Ad groups</p>
<p>Each ad group should represent a customers desire or mindset</p>
<p>Step 1: Collect keywords with a text editor<br />
Step 2: Input the words into the AdTool and generate new ones</p>
<p>peeling and sticking refers to tightening ad groups by moving keywords into new ad<br />
groups — and writing ads that more specifically target those keywords.</p>
<p>Step 3: Sort the keywords with Excel</p>
<p>The first sheet is my summary sheet. It includes the names of all my ad groups and<br />
the search volume for each group.</p>
<p>Go to www.askhowie.com/keywords5 for a video demonstration of using<br />
Excel for keyword management.</p>
<p>== Negative keywords</p>
<p>www.lexfn.com <br />
If you’re bidding on bat as a broad match, you’re going to show your ad<br />
to a lot of the wrong people.</p>
<p>Searching Google for negative keywords</p>
<p>Finding negative keywords with the AdWords Keyword Tool<br />
First, go to the ad group you’re working on by logging in to your account and<br />
choosing the campaign and ad group from the Campaign Summary screen.<br />
From within that ad group, click the Keywords Tab and select the Keyword<br />
Tool. Enter your keyword, making sure the Use Synonyms check box is<br />
selected, and click the Get More Keywords button.</p>
