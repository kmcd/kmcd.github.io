   <p><span class="caps">FOREWORD</span></p>
<p>Welcome to the most sought after direct marketing masterpiece. This book was<br />
recently selling for over $900 dollars used—so I decided to re-issue it. It<br />
is a real privilege to bring Gene Schwartz&#8217;s advertising wisdom back into<br />
print. We built a wonderful business based on his wisdom.  He was a special<br />
delight and a treat to know—Gene was 6&#8217;2&quot; and reminded me of Gary Cooper<br />
in The Fountainhead. But Gene had much more charm and wit and a fabulous,<br />
unforgettable smile.  Exciting sight—watching the multi-talented genius&#8217;s<br />
fingers flying over the keyboard creating another brilliant ad. And then he&#8217;d<br />
sit back with that great smile, read it over and enjoy it more and more.<br />
Gene wrote advertising copy lor the best direct marketers in America. And<br />
then he published a book in 1964 titled Hoxc to Double Your Child&#8217;s Grades<br />
in School, following up with How to Double Your Power to Learn and then<br />
Breakthrough Advertising in 1966.  He was very clever—he exchanged his<br />
copywriting for access to mailing list names and promoted his own books<br />
to them!  But then Gene had a stroke in 1978 and he had trouble typing<br />
. . . for it affected his right side. But he worked and iii</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p><span class="caps">FOREWORD</span></p>
<p>worked until he became quite proficient typing with just his left hand.<br />
My big idea—Retain Gene as a business consultant instead of a copywriter to<br />
guarantee him a regular income. He became very important to us in that new<br />
role. l i e helped very much in the creation of the Bottom Line/Personal<br />
concept and of our editorial style. Awesome.  Then there was Gene <span class="caps">III</span>,<br />
the scientist, always reading the leading-edge science books and belonging<br />
to a very sophisticated group that met weekly to discuss the implications<br />
of those scientific advances on society.  Finally, there was Gene IV—an<br />
amazing talent as an art collector, together with his wife Barbara, a<br />
famous interior designer.  They built a fabulous art collection betting<br />
on Hans Hoffman Morris Lewis, Frank Stella, Donald Judd and Milton Averv<br />
well before anyone else had heard of them. Their first acquisition was by<br />
the color-pioneer Hans Hoffman. It took me years to appreciate Hoffman&#8217;s<br />
work. Barbara also helped me build an incredible collection of photographs<br />
that are now at the Art Institute of Chicago. On my first gallery tour<br />
with them—I discovered a crumpled photo by the Starn twins that had two<br />
words on i t Confusion/Order. That is what I&#8217;m devoted t o &#8211; b r i n g i n<br />
g order from confusion. So Barbara and I built a very exciting Lessons in<br />
Life collection. I was her first art advisory client. And it is with her<br />
generous permission that we bring Gene&#8217;s classic book back into the world.<br />

<p><span class="caps">PREFACE</span> TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BOARDROOM</span> <span class="caps">EDITION</span></p>
<p>This book was first published in 1966—what seems to be three lifetimes<br />
ago. It was put out bv Prentice-Hall, a marvelous house: it sold onlv a few<br />
thousand copies. But since it was published I have had people coming to me<br />
regularly to tell me that thev directlv credit reading this book with their<br />
making millions of dollars.  This is amazing enough, but even more remarkable<br />
is the fact that—when I look back on it—not a single one of these people<br />
was a copywriter. Here is a book that is called Breakthrough Advertising<br />
. . . and yet was used bv men who were not in the business of advertising at<br />
all, to make more monev than most of us ever dream of accumulating.  How did<br />
this happen? Whv was a publisher, a financier, a manufacturer of novelties,<br />
able to make so very much monev with a book that is about putting sentences<br />
together? (The financier told me that, within one vear after obtaining the<br />
book, he had raised his net worth from $100.000 to $10 million). Are the<br />
sentences contained in the pages that follow actually that powerful? Can<br />
they change the fortunes of men so radically? Are thev far more universally<br />
adaptable than I had first t h o u g h t . . . so they are no longer about<br />
advertising products, but literally about opening whole new markets for them?</p>
<p>\1</p>
<p><span class="caps">PREFACE</span></p>
<p>Therefore, eighteen years later, when Boardroom Books asked me to republish<br />
this text. I had to study it again, with the fresh eyes of a person who had<br />
not read it in all that time, to see what was the real content of my book,<br />
and its real effect on its readers.  I did. I discovered the secret. And<br />
I am using this introduction now to admit my red-faced shame. What I had<br />
thought I had written those mam- years ago was a book on advertising; what<br />
I actually put down on these pages was an entireh&#8217; different book, on a far<br />
broader theme: There is a way to develop an entirely new market for a new<br />
or an old product. That way involves a certain number of clearludefined<br />
steps. And in this hook 1 show „ou every single one of J those steps.<br />
&#8217; As you mav know, all of us—no matter what official designation we give<br />
the industry we do business m &#8211; a r e actually on a deeper level, in exactly<br />
the same profession. We are all&#8217;simply creating or exploiting markets for<br />
our products. When the market is born, our business is simultaneously given<br />
birth. When it grows so does our share of it. When it is mature, our sales<br />
charts develop heir first aches and pains. And at that point, if we can develop<br />
a fresh new- market for that old product, it is exactly as if we achieved<br />
the Faustian dream, and enabled that product to drink from the proverbial<br />
&#8220;Fountain of Youth.&#8221;  We are all primarily conceptual midwives. helping g i<br />
v e birth to new markets for our products. All the other functions&quot; we or our<br />
business, p e r f o r m &#8211; t h e manufacturing, distribution service hnancmg,<br />
and all the r e s t &#8211; a r e simply adjuncts to this vital central process.<br />
We are, in a single phrase, &#8220;Market-Makers.&#8221; We sense each new market in its<br />
turn. We test and evaluate its size and scope We gauge its true potential<br />
financial strength, and then we focus all the people, all the money and<br />
all the desire that makes it up on one ultimate object: our own product.<br />
Most of the time, the market exists before our product, and we simply tap<br />
its present strength. But, m this era of constant</p>
<p><span class="caps">PREFACE</span></p>
<p>Ml</p>
<p>change, we ourselves mav help give it its first viable financial form. We<br />
may sense that people want computers in their homes as well as their offices<br />
. . . or want to walk around all dav with music plugged into their ears<br />
. . . or would like to spend three air-conditioned hours in a faraway galaxv,<br />
battling with light-swords against evil and tyranny.  Making a market, then,<br />
is not. as I thought when I originally wrote this book, simply a matter of<br />
making an ad. It is also the making of a product. And it is the making of a<br />
conduit through which that product can be obtained bv the people whom you<br />
have made desire it more than an equivalent sum of their money. This book<br />
outwardly talks about the sentences that make up the primary appeal of that<br />
product to that market. But its true and deeper message is found when it is<br />
interpreted as a market-diviner, and a market-intensifier. In other words,<br />
its message will show vou how to find your &#8220;dream&#8221; market, and how to drive it<br />
into a national &#8220;feeding frenzy.&#8221;  And I have also made an equally important<br />
discovery upon reviewing this book since it was first published. The examples<br />
in its pages have grown slightly older, but the principles that these examples<br />
manifest are timeless. For example, if I were writing this book today, its<br />
examples would show more appreciation of feminism, environmental awareness,<br />
health and fitness striving— even the blessed sexual revolution. Thev would<br />
be more open and more frank than thev could have been then.  All this is for<br />
the good—but this book is not about revieiving todm/s ads, but creating from<br />
scratch tomorrow&#8217;s winners! This book is about avoiding the need for copying<br />
or imitating am other product or advertisement. So today&#8217;s examples are as<br />
&#8220;outdated&#8221; as those of two decades ago. This book is about what-happensnext,<br />
and the fundamental rules of making a fortune out of slightly redirecting<br />
that tomorrow.  You see, people don&#8217;t change: only the direction of their<br />
desires do. They cannot be made to want anything, nor is it necessary to<br />
create want. All that is necessary is to be able to channel</p>
<p>v U1</p>
<p><span class="caps">PREFACE</span></p>
<p>those wants into the proper products that offer legitimate satisfaction<br />
for them. It takes ten million . . . fifteen million . . . twentvfive<br />
million. . . fifty&#8212; million . . . one hundred and fifty million people<br />
. . . to create a vast market for your goods. But it takes only one slip<br />
of paper—or its recitation by a series of salesmen—to direct all those<br />
millions of people to your stores, or vour catalogues, or your wholesalers.<br />
Not one single thing has changed in that regard since I wrote this book. Nor<br />
will it ever alter in the slightest.  So this book is not about building<br />
better mousetraps. It is, however, about building larger mice, and then<br />
building terrifying fear of them in your customers. In other words, it is<br />
about helping to shape the largest and strongest market possible, and then<br />
intensifying that market&#8217;s reaction to its basic need or problem, and to the<br />
&#8220;exclusive&#8221; solution vou have to offer it.  Ask Rodale Press—for whom I<br />
sold over twentv million dollars of a single book, The Practical Encyclopedia<br />
of Natural Healing.  Ask the publisher of this book. Boardroom Reports,<br />
Inc.— who started out with $3,500 in total working capital, and who will<br />
probably do more than 25 million dollars in gross volume next year, with I am<br />
proud to say at least a little bit of assistance from me.  Ask the seventeen<br />
businesses I&#8217;ve started or helped start. . .  (Twenty-five percent of just one<br />
of them was sold for close to a million dollars in one dav.)  These principles<br />
work. They discover markets. Thev build markets. They intensify markets. Thev<br />
revitalize markets. They perform, in sum, the invaluable function of giving you<br />
customers for the products you want or have to sell.  And that&#8217;s what we all<br />
need, isn&#8217;t it? Customers. This, therefore, is a book full of customers—for<br />
your products.  It is really nothing else. Just customers, by the millions.<br />
Eighteen years have passed. Three lifetimes. They&#8217;ve been good years, and<br />
good lives. I hadn&#8217;t read the book since then, but</p>

<p>some hidden part of me had remembered it, and I think it&#8217;s worth your<br />

<p><span class="caps">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>Creativity Can Be Made to Order If You Follow This Simple Rule If you expect<br />
a scholarly tome on advertising, stop here.  I am a mail order copy writer<br />
who makes his living by producing results—in carefully-measured dollars of<br />
profit—from the written word.  My income—my standard of living—depends<br />
bluntly and directly upon my ability to sell. And I have no salesmen to<br />
help me; no store-reputation to help me: no point-of-purchase reminders,<br />
no discounts, no friendly sales clerks to give mv products a push.  I sell,<br />
or do not sell, on the basis of one tool alone—my ad Therefore, I have<br />
done a great deal of thinking and experimenting with these ads. And, since<br />
I have had the good fortune to own my own mail order firms for the last<br />
eleven years, I have had far greater freedom than most copy writers to put<br />
mv ideas to a conclusive test and to see whether or not they really work.<br />
I believe, as do many other advertising men, that mail order is the greatest<br />
copy writing school in the world. In mail order</p>
<p><span class="caps">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>for reasons which I&#8217;ll reveal later in this book, <span class="caps">YOU</span> learn techniques and<br />
approaches to copy—especially new-product and newslant copy—that you learn<br />
in no other branch of this business.  Some of these techniques I have never<br />
seen discussed in anv other article or book on copv writing—and I think<br />
I&#8217;ve read most of them. I have explained these techniques in detail in the<br />
hope that they will prove as profitable to other eopv writers as they&#8217;ve<br />
been for me.  Can they be used by non-mail-order eopv writers as well?<br />
Most assuredly. J. K. Lasker once said that mail order makes a copy writer,<br />
but his real pav-off comes when he applies his mail order techniques to<br />
general advertising. I think that B.B.D. &amp; O., Ted Bates, Ogilvy, Young &amp;<br />
Rubicam and a dozen other agencies prove this every day.  Therefore I&#8217;ve<br />
written this book—not from the mail order perspective alone—but from the<br />
universal problem of all eopv writing: How to write a headline—and an ad that<br />
follows it—that will open up an entirely new market for its product. An ad<br />
that will give a new product immediate profit: that will give an old product<br />
a brand-new slant; that will give a competitively-battered product a new<br />
weapon—not onlv to protect itself against its imitators but to actually<br />
damage or destrov the loyalty of their following.  These objectives cannot<br />
be achieved by following somebody else&#8217;s formula—no matter how successful<br />
it was for them. Thev demand creativity Thev demand a brand-new headline;<br />
a brandnew approach to the market: a literal advertising &#8220;breakthrough.&#8221;<br />
Hence the title of this book.  This, then, is a practical book, of practical<br />
rules that produce, and exploit, creativity, and that are meant to pay off<br />
on the very first ad. To put them to work, vou start with these basic facts.</p>
<p><span class="caps">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p>Basic Facts of Life for Copy Writers Writing copy is like playing the<br />
stock market, or being an atomic physicist.  Basically all three of these<br />
professions—eopv writing, speculation and science—are exactly alike. The<br />
same keys make each one of them work. And if you realize win. vou can double<br />
the effectiveness of your copy overnight.  Consider these facts: All three<br />
of them deal with immense natural forces gargantuan forces thousands of times<br />
more powerful than the men who use them. In science, they are the fundamental<br />
energies of the universe. In speculation, they are the billion-dollar tides and<br />
currents of the market place. In copy writing thetj are the hopes and fears<br />
and desires of millions upon millions of men and women, all over the world.<br />
The men who use these forces did not create them; thev can neither turn them on<br />
nor shut them off thev can neither diminish them nor add to them. But they ran<br />
harness them! The scientist did not create the energy of the sun; hut he can<br />
direct that energy into the explosion of an atom bomb. The speculator did not<br />
create the enormous growth of the electronics industry after the war: but he<br />
can ride that growth to produce a fifty times increase in his capital. And the<br />
copy writer does not create the desire of millions of women all over America<br />
to lose weight; but he can channel that desire onto a particular product,<br />
and make its owner a millionaire.  This, then, is the end goal—to take these<br />
gigantic natural forces and harness them to our own uses. But how do we do it?<br />
No two of these forces are alike. Each is unique; each operates in a different<br />
way The same formula, earefullv worked out to release atomic energy, fails<br />
complete])- to solve the problem of rocket propulsion. The same pattern of<br />
investment, that spots the upturn in electronics and makes a fortune, loses<br />
that fortune in uranium. And the same advertising appeal, that builds an industrv <br />
in reducing, collapses completely when applied to health foods, even<br />
though both advertisements may reach exactly the same audience.  Whv? Because<br />
no formula works twice. Each and every formula is simplv the written solution<br />
to a particular problem that occurred in the past. Change even one part of<br />
that problem, and vou need an entirelv different formula. That&#8217;s why memorizing<br />
theories won&#8217;t make vou a scientist, or studying charts won&#8217;t make you a market<br />
wizard, or rewriting somebody else&#8217;s headlines won&#8217;t make vou a copy writer.<br />
What will work? Innovation, of course. Continuous, repeated innovation. A<br />
steady stream of new ideas—fresh new solutions to new problems. Created—not<br />
by the impossible route of memory—but by analysis.  In afield in which the<br />
rales are constantly changing—where the forces that determine the outcome<br />
are constantly shifting— where new problems are constantly being encountered<br />
every day— rules, formulas and principles simply will not work. They are<br />
too rigid—too tightly bound to the past. They must he replaced by the only<br />
known method of dealing with the Constantly New— analysis.  And what is<br />
analysis? It is a series of measuring rods, cheekpoints, signpost questions<br />
that show you where a particular force is going, and enable you to get<br />
there first. It is a series of rough guesses, based on past successes,<br />
that enables you to cut through the surface of a problem to see what makes<br />
it tick. Analysis is the art of asking the right questions and letting the<br />
problem dictate the right answers. It is the technique of the break-through.<br />
And it can be learned—just as surely as grammar, mathematics or spelling.<br />
The first part of this book is about analysis, applied to the profession<br />
of copy writing. Its basic thesis is this: Everv new market—everv new<br />
product—every newadvertisement is a fresh new problem that never existed<br />
before on the face of this earth. Past advertising successes</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get right down to the heart of the matter. The power, the force, the<br />
overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market<br />
itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a product.<br />
It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in<br />
the hearts of millions of people, and focus those alreadyexisting desires<br />
onto a particular product. This is the copy writer&#8217;s task: not to create<br />
this mass desire—but to channel and direct it.  Actually, it would be<br />
impossible for any one advertiser to spend enough money to actually create<br />
this mass desire. He can only exploit it. And he dies when he tries to run<br />
against it.  This has been shown time and time again in the automotive field,<br />
for example. In 1948, in order to display their rising standard of living,<br />
the American public decided they wanted a longer, lower, wider car. Chrysler<br />
chose to buck the trend; and offered a</p>

<p>fine, functional car—with more head, leg and shoulder room on the<br />
inside—but shorter and squatter on the outside. A multimillion-dollar<br />
campaign was prepared bv one of the most creative agencies in America. But<br />
the results—against the tide of mass desire—were catastrophic.  In 1954,<br />
cars had become universallv long; and drivers were appraising each other&#8217;s car<br />
in terms of horsepower. Here was the rise to dominance of a vast new public<br />
demand. The Twin-H Hudson Hornet, the twin-exhaust Cadillac, the Chrysler<br />
300—all in turn exploited this trend, and rode it to gain millions of<br />
dollars in extra sales. The Ford Company decided to plav it down, and devoted<br />
millions of advertising dollars to sell safety. Again, the advertising ran<br />
into a wall of disinterest: results were nonexistent; and the next year Ford<br />
produced, and advertised, the highest-horsepower engines in their history YVut<br />
perhaps \Vie most pamTu\ prooY was the Edsel. H e r e was a good car, backed<br />
by a deluge of fhu&lt; advertising, that died trying to fight the overwhelming<br />
switch in demand to a cheap, simple, inexpensive-to-run compact car.  Let me<br />
repeat. This mass desire must already be there. It must already exist. You<br />
cannot create it. and vou cannot fight it.  But you can—and must—direct<br />
it, channel it. focus it onto your particular product.</p>
<p>What Is This Mass Desire—and How Is It Created?  We can define this Mass<br />
Desire quite simply. It is the public spread of a private want.  Advertising is<br />
a business of statistics. We deal with percentages of population. We address<br />
our ads to individuals; and yet the success of our advertising depends on<br />
thousands, or even millions, of these individuals sharing the same response<br />
to these ads—the response of wanting our product enough to pav us the<br />
price we ask for it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MASS</span> <span class="caps">DESIRE</span>: T H E <span class="caps">FORCE</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> <span class="caps">MAKES</span> <span class="caps">ADVERTISING</span> <span class="caps">WORK</span></p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Before these individuals can share this buying response, they must first share<br />
the desire upon which our ad is based.  Privately, each of them wants the same<br />
thing. Puhliclx. there are enough of them to repay us the cost of advertising,<br />
manufacturing and selling, plus a profit. It is the moment alien a private<br />
desire is shared by a statistically significant number of people, large<br />
enough to profitably repay selling these people, that a market is born. This<br />
market mav consist of a desire shared by only a few thousand people, such<br />
as the urge to own fine antiques. Or it may be shared by tens of millions,<br />
as the desire to lose weight. But it is there, demanding to be satisfied,<br />
waiting only for the information that will direct it onto a particular product.<br />
Since these mass desires are shared bv millions of people.  they take years to<br />
develop, and thev are created b\ social, economic and technological forces<br />
far greater than advertising itself can command. It is this fact, when<br />
used correctly that gives advertising its enormous potential for profit. Bv<br />
simplv directing this gigantic, already-existing mass desire—rather than<br />
being required to create it—advertising thus commands an economic force<br />
hundreds of times more poiveifnl Hum the mere number of dollars that the<br />
advertiser can spend on it. This is the Amplification Effect of successful<br />
advertising—the reason that $1 spent on such advertising can create 850<br />
or even SI00 in sales.  But this Amplification Effect takes place only<br />
when advertising exploits already-existing desire. When it tries to create<br />
this desire, it is no longer advertising but education. And, as education.<br />
it can produce at best only one dollar in sales for every dollar spent on<br />
advertising. No single advertiser can afford to educate the American public. He<br />
must rely on forces far greater than any advertising budget to build this mass<br />
desire. And then he can make those forces work for him—by directing that<br />
desire onto his particular product.  What are these nation-wide forces that<br />
create this mass desire? There are many of them. But they fall into two general</p>

<p>categories—each presenting its distinct problem to the copy writer.<br />
Here are these two categories, with a few specific examples of each.<br />
1. Permanent Forces Mass Instinct. The desire of women to be attractive, or<br />
men to be virile, or men and women both to keep their health. In this case,<br />
the instinct never fades—the desire never changes. The copy writer&#8217;s<br />
problem here is not to pick out the trend—it is there for everyone to<br />
see. His job is to distinguish his product from the others that were there<br />
before it—to create a fresh appeal—to build a stronger believabilitv—to<br />
shift desire from the fulfillment offered by one product to that offered bv<br />
another.  How this is done, we shall see in a moment.  A mass technological<br />
problem. Bad television reception, or corroding automobile mufflers, or the<br />
time it takes for aspirin to bring relief. Until the problem is finallv<br />
solved, the customers will buy and try—buy and try again. And here the<br />
copy writer has the same problem—to offer the same claim of relief as<br />
his competitors, but offer it in a new way.  2. The Forces of Change The<br />
beginning, the fulfillment, and the reversal of a trend.  Style. The sudden<br />
mass decision to show off a pay raise bv installing a swimming pool in the<br />
back yard, instead of buying a bigger car. The horsepower appeal of the<br />
Fifties, and its sudden subordination to gas economy. Here the copv writer<br />
is dealing with the straws in the wind that may indicate a hurricane. Here<br />
he needs sensitivity, foresight, intuition. He must be able to see and catch<br />
the rising tide when it&#8217;s almost imperceptible—sense which of the several<br />
appeals that are built into his product he should stress at any particular<br />
moment, and when to shift to another—and, always, how to be there first.</p>

<p>Mass Education. The school primer and the movie screen.  The tastes and<br />
appearances of society women, television stars, presidential candidates,<br />
trickling down to every hamlet in America. Group pressure; back-yard<br />
gossip; community product pioneers. And equally important, the sum total<br />
of all advertising—in its unconscious, unplanned and overall effect of<br />
multiplying people&#8217;s dreams and desires, and thus raising their standard<br />
of living. Here again the problem is timing. When does the shift become<br />
statistically significant? When do enough people make the change? When should<br />
the automotive powerhouse, for example, change its image to become the common<br />
man&#8217;s gas saver?  The copy writer is faced with a society containing dozens—<br />
even hundreds—of these already-existing mass desires. His first joh therefore<br />
is to detect them—inventory them—chart their force and direction. This is<br />
a study that will occupy part of every working dav for the rest of his life.<br />
His second job is to harness his products onto their backs.  He does this in<br />
this wav: How to Channel Mass Desire Onto Your Particular Product The copy<br />
writer in his work uses three tools: his own knowledge of people&#8217;s hopes,<br />
dreams, desires and emotions; his client&#8217;s product; and the advertising<br />
message, which connects the two.  The copy writer performs his work in three<br />
stages. In general, thev go something like this: 1. Choose the most powerful<br />
desire that can possibly he applied to your product.  Every mass desire has<br />
three vital dimensions. The first is urgency, intensity, degree of demand<br />
to be satisfied. For example, constant arthritic pains compared to a minor<br />
headache. The second dimension is staving power, degree of repetition, the<br />
inability to become satiated. For example, raw hunger compared to a craving<br />
for gourmet foods. And the third dimension is scope—</p>

<p>the number of people who share this desire. For example, the number of men<br />
willing to pay $10 for an automotive accessorv that saves gas—as compared<br />
to those willing to pav the same price for one that merely prevents future<br />
repair bills.  Every product appeals to two, three or four of these mass<br />
desires. But only one can predominate; onlv one can reach out through your<br />
headline to your customer. Only one is the key that unlocks the maximum<br />
economic power at the particular time your advertisement is published. Your<br />
choice among these alternate desires is the most important step yon will take<br />
in writing your ad.  If it is wrong, nothing else that you do in the ad will<br />
matter. This choice is embodied in your headline. It is for this reason that we<br />
spend so many chapters on headlines later on.  To sum up the first stage then,<br />
you trv to choose the mass desire that gives you the most power in all three<br />
dimensions. You try to tap a single overwhelming desire existing today in the<br />
hearts and minds of millions of people who are actively seeking to satisfy it<br />
at this verv moment.  2. Acknowledge that desire—reinforce it—and/or offer<br />
the means to satisfy it—in a single statement in the headline of your ad.<br />
This headline is the bridge between vour prospect and your product. It touches<br />
your prospect at the point of awareness that he has arrived at today. If<br />
he is aware of vour product, and realizes that it can satisfy his desire,<br />
vour headline starts with vour product. If he is not aware of your product,<br />
but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. And,<br />
if he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned only with<br />
a general problem, your headline starts with that problem and crystallizes<br />
it into a specific need.  In any case, your headline—though it mav never<br />
mention your product—is the first vital step in recognizing this mass<br />
desire—justifying and intensifying it—and directing its solution along<br />
one specific path.  3. And then you take the series of performances that are</p>

<p>9</p>
<p>built into your product—what your product does—and you show your prospect<br />
how these product performances inevitably satisfy that desire. Here&#8217;s how:<br />
The Analysis of Your Product: What It Is—and What It D o e s In reality,<br />
every product vou are given to sell is actually two products. One of them is<br />
the physical product—the steel, glass, paper or tobacco that the manufacturer<br />
has shaped into a particular pattern, of which he is justly proud. The other<br />
is the functional product—the product in action—the series of benefits<br />
that vour product performs for vour consumer, and on the basis of which<br />
he buys vour product.  The physical product does not sell. People do not<br />
buy the steel in a car, the glass in a vase, the tobacco in a cigarette,<br />
or the paper in a book.  The physical part of your product is of value only<br />
because it enables your product to do things for people. The important part of<br />
your product is what it does. The rest—the steel skeleton—the chrome or<br />
metal case that vou actually deliver to your customer—is only your excuse<br />
for charging them your price. What they are reallv paying you for is what<br />
the product will do.  No physical part of vour product can ever become a<br />
headline. No one will buy the size of vour clients plant, the weight of vour<br />
client&#8217;s steel, the care of vour client&#8217;s construction. All these facts can<br />
only be used, later on. to document and reinforce the primary performance<br />
that vou promise your reader in your headline, in the following wavs: By<br />
justifying your price. This is the common-sense theory that the longer the<br />
car, the more tubes in the television set, the more stitches per inch in the<br />
suit, then the greater the number of dollars your product can command—if<br />
that product first delivers the performance that your prospect demands.<br />
By documenting the quality of your performance. Tell your</p>

<p>prospect the weight of steel in vour car&#8217;s door, and he&#8217;s more likely to<br />
believe that your car will protect his life if he should have an accident on<br />
the highway. Tell vour prospect the number of times your plant removes the<br />
impurities in vour face cream, and she&#8217;s more likely to believe that vour<br />
cream will remove the impurities in her skin.  By assuring your prospect that<br />
that performance will continue throughout the years. Ceramic mufflers mean no<br />
repair bills for the life of your car. Chemically-protected paper means you<br />
can hand your prize books down to vour children. Quick-frozen food means vou<br />
can retain taste and vitamins for months after your purchase.  By sharpening<br />
the reader&#8217;s mental picture of that performance. The Rolls-Royce must give vou<br />
perfect riding silence because every metal part of the chassis is shielded from<br />
every other metal part by a protective coat of rubber. Helena Rubenstein&#8217;s<br />
new face cream must make your skin look younger because it contains the<br />
placenta of living animals.  And, above all, by giving your product&#8217;s<br />
claim of performance afresh new basis for believability. This is the most<br />
important use of the physical product in fields where a new firm or product<br />
is attempting to invade an established Mass Instinct field. Others have made<br />
the same claim before. Your product, in order to pull sales awav from them,<br />
must introduce a new mechanism that performs the claim, or a new quality<br />
that assures its performance, or a new freedom from old limitations that<br />
improves the performance. This is the point of difference—often conceived<br />
by the copy writer, and built bv the manufacturer into the product at his<br />
recommendation. We shall discuss this point of difference quite thoroughly<br />
in the next few chapters.  So much for the physical product. It is always<br />
subordinated to the functional product—the product in action—what the<br />
product does.  It is the performance of your product, satisfying the mass<br />
desire of your market, that provides the selling power of your ad.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MASS</span> <span class="caps">DESIRE</span>: T H E <span class="caps">FORCE</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> <span class="caps">MAKES</span> <span class="caps">ADVERTISING</span> <span class="caps">WORK</span></p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Your first task, then, in studying your product, is to list the number of<br />
different performances it contains—to group these performances against<br />
the mass desires that each of them satisfies—and then to feature the<br />
one performance that will harness the greatest sales power onto vour<br />
product at that particular time.  Take the automobile, for example. Every<br />
automobile offers its prospective owner several different and distinct sets of<br />
performances: It offers him transportation. The ability to carry himself, his<br />
family, his luggage, and perhaps tin the case of station wagons) his pets and<br />
his furniture from place to place.  It offers him dependability. The freedom<br />
from breakdown, stalling, poor performance, repair bills, embarrassment<br />
and inconvenience.  It offers him economy. Inexpensive transportation:<br />
savings in both gas and oil; freedom from repair bills, seen this time<br />
from the point of view of the pocket book: durability high trade-in value,<br />
low insurance cost.  It offers him power. Number of horses at his command;<br />
takeoff at the lights: acceleration on hills and in traffic; top speed, even<br />
if he never uses it. All adding up to a feeling of dominance on the highway.<br />
It offers him recognition. Admiration, status, subtle and accepted bragging,<br />
envy, the feeling of having arrived. The ohs and ahs of his neighbors,<br />
the first ride, the very smell of a new car.  It offers him value. The<br />
number of feet of steel he can command for the price. High trade-in value<br />
over the years. The fact that the car can last for 100,000 miles, even if<br />
he can afford to trade it in every year.  It offers him novelty: Power<br />
steering five vears ago—electric door locks todav. Three-tone paint<br />
jobs vesterdav—iridescent paints now. The thrill of being the leader,<br />
the pace-setter, the proven pioneer.  And man\- more. Some of them hidden,<br />
never admitted, discovered only recently bv motivation research. Dozens of</p>

<p>different performances, built into the same product, each of them reaching<br />
out and tapping a different desire—a distinct public.  And yet your ad<br />
can feature onlv one of these performances; can effectively tap only one<br />
mass desire at a time.  Your headline is limited by physical space. You have<br />
onlv one glance of the reader&#8217;s eye to stop him. He is preoccupiedhe is not<br />
looking for your product or your message—the span of his attention will<br />
admit only one thought to penetrate his indifference during that glance.<br />
If your first thought holds him. he will read the second. If the second<br />
holds him, he will read the third. And if the third thought holds him,<br />
he will probably read through your ad.  Every product gives you dozens of<br />
keys. But onlv one will fit the lock. Your job is to find that one dominant<br />
performance squeeze every drop of power out of it in your presentation—and<br />
then convince your reader that that performance and that satisfaction can come<br />
onlv from your product.  The next four chapters will show von how to locate<br />
that one dominant performance, and how to fasliion it into vour headline.<br />
Once you have written that headline, then even other performance contained<br />
in your product simply reinforces and documents that main appeal, in exactly<br />
the same wav as the physical product facts listed above.</p>
<p>2 <span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF AWARENESS—HOW TO <span class="caps">CAPITALIZE</span> ON IT W H E N <span class="caps">YOU</span><br />
<span class="caps">WRITE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">HEADLINE</span></p>
<p>You have now completed the first two stages in writing your ad. You have<br />
defined the mass desire that makes up your market—for example, the desire<br />
to lose weight, shared by millions of women all over America. And you have<br />
selected the one performance in vour product that satisfies that desire<br />
most deeply—for example, a liquid meal in a glass, delicious, filling,<br />
already measured for you. as easy and pleasant to drink as a chocolate malted.<br />
This definition of vour market, and the selection of the product performance<br />
most likely to capture that market, forms the core concept, or theme, of<br />
vour ad. You now know where you are going to start—with your market; and<br />
where you are going to end—with your product. The bridge between these<br />
two—their meeting place—is your ad.  Your ad always begins with your<br />
market, and leads that 13</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>market inevitably into your product. The beginning of vour ad— your<br />
headline—is the first step in this process. Therefore it concerns itself<br />
entirely with your market. It mav never even mention your product or its<br />
performance. It is based entirely on the answer to these three questions:<br />
1. What is the mass desire that creates this market? (Which we have already<br />
discovered.)  2. How much do these people know today about the way your<br />
product satisfies this desire? (Their State of Awareness.)  3. How many<br />
other products have been presented to them before yours? (Their State<br />
of Sophistication.  The answer to question 1 gives von the nation-wide<br />
force that creates your market. The answer to questions 2 and 3 gives you<br />
the location of that market in relation to vour product. Your strategy for<br />
exploiting or overcoming the answers to these last two questions will give<br />
you the content of vour headline. Let&#8217;s first re-define the job we are going<br />
to ask our headline to do, and then see how each of these last two questions<br />
tells us what that headline should—and should not—saw</p>
<p>Your Headline&#8217;s Real Job There has been much confusion about how much of a<br />
selling job your headline should be required to do. Actually, your headline<br />
does not need to sell at all. It does not have to mention your product. It<br />
does not even have to mention vour main appeal. To demand that a headline<br />
should do any of these is to place the full selling burden on approximately<br />
10% to 20% of the total physical space of your ad . . . that physical space<br />
taken up by the headline itself.  Your headline has only one job—to stop<br />
your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad. In<br />
exactly the same way, your second sentence has only one job—to force him<br />
to read the third sentence of vour ad. And the third sentence</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>15</p>
<p>—and every additional sentence in your ad—has exactly the same job.<br />
It is simply common sense that the more of vour storv vou can force your<br />
prospect to read, the more thoroughly you can sell him. To attempt to do the<br />
same selling job in ten words, instead of a hundred, or a thousand, is to<br />
shoot craps with vour clients money. You might as well bnv only enough space<br />
to print vour headline, and use the rest of the budget for repeat insertions.<br />
It is the copy writer&#8217;s job to force the prospect to read his client&#8217;s full<br />
story—not just a skimmed version of it. Only to prospects actively seeking<br />
the client&#8217;s specific brand-name product, and in a case where you can offer<br />
them a special price reduction, can your headline do the full selling job. To<br />
attempt a complete selling job with anv other kind of headline is simply to<br />
admit defeat.</p>
<p>What Your Prospect&#8217;s State of Awareness Demands From Your Headline We have<br />
already assumed that the only reader you are looking for is the prospect for<br />
vour product. That means that he shares a defined desire with thousands,<br />
and perhaps even millions, of other people all over America. But how much<br />
aware is that prospect of that desire? How close is it to the surface<br />
of his consciousness? Is he aware only that a problem or need exists, or<br />
is he aware if they can be satisfied? And if he is aware that a means of<br />
satisfaction exists, does he realize that it lies in your iiroup of products,<br />
or specifically in your product by name, or more specifically in your product<br />
at a given price?  The answer to these questions will help you determine the<br />
State of Awareness of your market—their present state of knowledge about<br />
your product and the satisfaction that your product performs. It is at this<br />
precise point of awareness that vour headline begins.</p>

<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>In its natural development, everv market&#8217;s awareness passes through several<br />
stages. The more aware your market, the easier the selling job, the less vou<br />
need to sav. Let&#8217;s go down the awareness scale step by step. We&#8217;ll start at<br />
the Most Aware—the most mechanical selling job—and proceed to more and<br />
more difficult problems, requiring more and more creative solutions.  1. The<br />
Most Aware The customer knows of your product—knows what it does— knows he<br />
wants it. At this point, he just hasn&#8217;t gotten around to buying it yet. Your<br />
headline—in fact, vour entire ad—need state little more except the name of<br />
your product and a bargain price.  For example: &#8220;Revere Zomar Lens, Electric<br />
Eve Camera—Formerly $149.50—Now Only $119.95.&#8221;  The remainder of the<br />
advertisement can summarize quicklv the most desirable selling points. Then add<br />
the name of a store, or a coupon, and close.  This is the typical department<br />
store, discount store, mailorder-bargain-catalog type of advertising. It takes<br />
advantage of the full weight of all the advertising that has been done on the<br />
same product before it. Its addition—its news—is the price—or a free<br />
gift—or instant delivery—or proximity in the neighborhood. Its prospect<br />
is fully aware—he has all the information he needs. Here the copy writer<br />
is nothing more than the merchandise manager&#8217;s phrase-maker. The price is the<br />
most important part of his headline. There is nothing creative about his job,<br />
and he should receive the lowest possible scale of pav.  2. The Customer Knows<br />
of the Product But Doesn&#8217;t Yet Want It Here, your prospect isn&#8217;t completely<br />
aware of all your product does, or isn&#8217;t convinced of how well it does it,<br />
or hasn&#8217;t yet been told how much better it does it now.</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Here—in the approach to this market—is the great bulk of all<br />
advertising. Here you are dealing with a product which is known—which<br />
has established a brand name—which has alreadylinked itself with an<br />
acknowledged public desire, and has proven that it satisfied that desire.<br />
Here vour headline is faced with one of seven tasks: (a) To reinforce<br />
your prospects desire for your product: (b) To sharpen his image of the<br />
way vour product satisfies that desire; &#169; To extend his image of where<br />
and when vour product satisfies that desire; (d) To introduce new proof,<br />
details, documentation of how well vour product satisfies that desire;<br />
(e) To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy<br />
that desire e\-en better; (f) To announce a new mechanism in vour product<br />
that eliminates former limitations; (g) Or to completely change the image<br />
or the mechanism of that product, in order to remove it from the competition<br />
of other products claiming to satisfy the same desire.  In all seven cases,<br />
the approach is the same. You display the name of the product—either in the<br />
headline or in an equally large logo—and use the remainder of the headline to<br />
point out its superioritv. The body of the ad is then an elaboration of that<br />
superiority—including visualization, documentation, mechanization. When<br />
you have finished weaving in everv strand of vour product&#8217;s superiority7,<br />
your ad is done.  Here are sample headlines presenting solutions to all seven<br />
of the problems of this state of awareness: (a) To reinforce your prospect&#8217;s<br />
desire for your product— bv using: <span class="caps">ASSOCIATION</span>:</p>

Here we are dealing with the State of Sophistication of our market—the<br />
amount of exposure they have already had to similar products. Every product<br />
during its life history encounters this problem. All of Chapter 3 will be<br />
devoted to some of the approaches to its solution.  We now move on to the<br />
less aware markets—with their more difficult copv challenges, and their<br />
greater demand for the unprecedented.  3. How to Introduce N e w Products<br />
The prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what<br />
the product does; but he doesn&#8217;t yet know&#8217; that there is a product—your<br />
product—that will do it for him.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>Here the problem is two-fold. First, to pinpoint the illdefined,<br />
as-vet-uncrvstallized desire that is slowly spreading through great masses<br />
of people all over America. And second, to crystallize that desire, and its<br />
solution, so sharplv and so dramatically that each and every prospect will<br />
recognize it at a glance.  The three steps in the process are simple. Name the<br />
desire and/or its solution in vour headline. Prove that that solution can be<br />
accomplished. And show that the mechanism of that accomplishment is contained<br />
in vour product.  However, starting with a market in this still-amorphous state<br />
of awareness, and continuing with each of the more difficult challenges to<br />
come, the execution becomes more and more important than the mechanics. Here<br />
the eopv writer contributes more and more to the value of the product in the<br />
public eve, and to its total volume of sales. Here the innovator comes into<br />
play. Here the ratio of salary of copy writer to production supervisor shoots<br />
up abruptly. For this is the domain of the idea man.  What are the attributes<br />
he needs 0 First, analysis. As a copy writer vou will find it necessary to<br />
define the particular market most receptive to vour product, its location<br />
in relation to your product in terms of awareness and sophistication,<br />
and the driving emotional forces that have created both that market and<br />
the potential for the sales of vour product within it.  Second, intuition,<br />
which may be described as the ability to sense a trend at its start, gauge<br />
its force and direction, determine the precise moment when it burgeons into<br />
a profitable market.  And third, verbal creativity, as discussed in the<br />
next three chapters, and throughout the rest of the book. The ability to<br />
give a name to the still-undefined. To capture a feeling, a hope, a desire,<br />
a fear in words. To create a catchword or a slogan. To focus emotion, and<br />
give it a goal.  Let us see how great writers in the past have taken these</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>21</p>
<p>amorphous desires, and brought them into razor-sharp focus in a single<br />
statement in their headline: &#8220;Light a Lucky, and vou&#8217;ll never miss sweets<br />
that make you fat.&#8221;  &#8220;Who else wants a whiter wash—with no hard work&#8217;:&#8221;&quot;<br />
&#8220;How to win friends and influence people.  &quot;To men who want to cjuit work<br />
some day.  &quot;When doctors feel rotten—this is what they do.&#8217;  &quot;Now! Run your<br />
car without spark plugs&#8217;&#8217; &quot;Who ever heard of 17,000 /&gt;/&lt;&gt;om* ironi a single<br />
plant 0 &quot; And dozens more. Here, amorphous desire has been crystallized in the<br />
headline. Then sharpened and expanded in the first few paragraphs; satisfied<br />
and documented in the body of the ad: and focussed inevitably on the product<br />
throughout.  Sometimes the simplest statement of the desire is the best.<br />
&#8220;How to win friends and influence people&#8221; needs no verbal twist to increase<br />
its impact. At other times, the desire itself must be reinforced by fresh<br />
proof that it can be achieved, &#8220;When doctors feel rotten—this is what they<br />
do&#8221;. Or by mystery, &#8220;Now! Run your car without spark plugs!&#8221; Or by wonderment,<br />
&#8220;Who ever heard of 17,000 blooms from a single plant?&#8221;. The next two chapters<br />
will discuss, first, the strategy of determining when to use a fresh approach;<br />
and second, how- to sharpen that first statement of desire with verbalization.</p>
<p>4. H o w to Introduce Products That Solve Needs The prospect has—not a<br />
desire—but a need. He recognizes the need immediately. But he doesn&#8217;t yet<br />
realize the connection between the fulfillment of that need and your product.<br />
This is the problem-solving ad. It might be thought of as a special case of<br />
the desire ad mentioned above, since the tech-</p>
<p>&#8217;Z&#8217;Z</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>nique of writing it is so similar. H e r e you start need and/or its solution<br />
in your headline. Then need so vividly that the prospect realizes just how<br />
the solution. And then present your product as solution.</p>
<p>bv naming the dramatize the badlv he needs the inevitable</p>
<p>Again, this type of ad runs from the most naked statement of the need alone, to<br />
the most complicated verbal twists to bring it to the peak of impact. To start<br />
at the beginning, the most effective possible headline for your particular<br />
problem mav be as simple as this: &#8220;Corns?&#8221;  Here, only the problem itself<br />
is mentioned—nothing more.  Or it may be necessary to state both problem<br />
and solution immediately: &#8220;Stops maddening itch.&#8221;  Many headlines in this<br />
category promise the removal of previously unconquerable limitations. They are<br />
especially popular in catalog selling: &#8220;Lets portable transistor radios play<br />
on ordinary household current.&#8221;  And many combine all three elements—the<br />
problem, its solution, and the removal of the usually expected limitations:<br />
&#8220;Shrinks hemorrhoids without surgerv.&#8221;  There are headlines which promise<br />
substitutes for unpleasant or expensive tasks: &#8220;Now! A ring and piston job<br />
in a tube!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>^o</p>
<p>And there are headlines which promise to prevent a future problem, before it<br />
can occur: &#8220;Look, Mom! No cavities!&#8221;  But many times the problem is not so<br />
clearly defined, not so obviously on the surface. You may know the general<br />
area of the problem—for example, people&#8217;s embarrassment at speaking poor<br />
English. But you may not be sure of which avenue is the most effective<br />
in reaching them. Here the emphasis of a single w o r d—the emotional<br />
sharpening of an already easily-identified image—provides the answer:<br />
&#8220;Do <span class="caps">YOU</span> make these mistakes in English0&#8221; And, where the solution to the<br />
need has been promised before—where the direct statement of the solution<br />
has lost its force and freshness—then verbal twists are needed to restore<br />
that novelty: &#8220;How a bald-headed barber helped save my hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>5. How to Open Up a Completely Unaware Market And finally—the most<br />
difficult. The prospect is either not aware of his desire or his need—or<br />
he won&#8217;t honestly admit it to himself without being lead into it by your<br />
ad—or the need is so general and amorphous that it resists being summed<br />
up in a single headline—or it&#8217;s a secret that just can&#8217;t be verbalized.<br />
This is the outer reach of the awareness scale. These are the people who are<br />
still the logical prospects for your product; and vet, in their own minds,<br />
they are hundreds of miles away from accepting that product. It is your job<br />
to bridge that gap.  Let me repeat what I said when we first began to explore<br />
these five stages of awareness. Each of these stages is separated from the<br />
others by a psychological wall. On one side of that wall is indifference;<br />
on the other, intense interest. A headline that</p>
<p>24 <span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>will work wonders in the first stage-for example, &quot;Dial Soap-90 a cake<br />
- w i l l fail completely when addressed to a third-stage market where<br />
your prospect doesn&#8217;t even realize that soaps can be made with built-in<br />
deodorants. And a third-stage headlinefor example &#8220;Who else wants a whiter<br />
wash with no hard work?&#8221;  &#8211; w i l l be old-hat, no-news to todays housewife,<br />
who has been barraged by whiter-than-white advertising for twenty years To sum<br />
up, then.- a headline which will work to&#8217;a market in one stage of awareness<br />
will not work to a market in another stage of awareness. Nor will it work,<br />
even to a market in which it has been successful, once that market passes<br />
on to a new stage b ot awareness.  Most products are designed to satisfy a<br />
specific need or desire. They are born into markets that are m at least the<br />
third or fourth stages of awareness. They may therefore never be faced with<br />
the problem of an unaware market.  However, many products actually pass out<br />
of public awareness or out of public acceptance-at some time or other during<br />
their hfe histories. The desire they satisfy dries up, or other products<br />
serve it better, or they are branded &quot;old-fashioned &quot; Again, we are dealing<br />
with a matter of statistics. When a product begins to slip . . . when volume<br />
falls off, even though advertising budgets are increased . . . when the<br />
name of the product no longer sells as much . . . when a direct statement<br />
of the product s function no longer sells as much . . . when a direct<br />
statement of the desire or the need that the product fulfills no longer<br />
sells as much-then that product needs to be reborn, and its problem is the<br />
problem of opening up an unatvare market Again, this is the most difficult,<br />
the most challenging probem of a 1. There are few positive milestones to<br />
guide vou But fortunately there are some completely self-evident negative<br />
rules that can eliminate many blind alleys, and set you face to face against<br />
your task. Planning a headline for a completely unaware or resistant market,<br />
then, is first of all a process of elimination&#8217; Here are the first paths:</p>
<p>25 <span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>1. Price means nothing to a person who does not know your product, or want<br />
your product. Therefore, eliminate all mention of price, or price reduction,<br />
in your headline or prime display type.  2. The name of vour product means<br />
nothing to a person who has never seen it&#8217;before, and may actually damage your<br />
ad if you have had a bad model the year before, or if it is now associated<br />
with the antiquated, the unfashionable, or the unpleasant. Therefore, keep<br />
vour product out of the headline, and be extremely wary about&#8217;breaking the<br />
mood or disguise of your ad with a prominent logo.  3. And this is the hardest<br />
fact of all to accept. At this stage of your market, a direct statement of<br />
what your product does, what desire it satisfies, or what problem it sokes,<br />
simply will not work. Your product either has not reached that direct stage,<br />
or has passed beyond it. And vou cannot simply shift from one desire to<br />
another. You are not faced here with a problem of sophistication, but one<br />
of complete indifference, or unacceptability. Therefore, the performance of<br />
vour product, and the desire it&#8217;satisfies, can only be brought in later. You<br />
cannot mention them in vour headline.  &#8217; So vou cannot mention price, product,<br />
function or desire.  What do vou have left? Your market, of course! And the<br />
distinct possibility that by broadening vour appeal beyond price, product<br />
function or specific desire, vou can reach the maximum limits of your full<br />
potential market; consolidate splinter appeals; and increase the sales of<br />
vour product at a fantastic rate.  Once you have accepted the challenge of<br />
writing this kind of ad, then vour product and its attributes fade into the<br />
background, and&#8217;you concentrate exclusively on the state of mind of vour<br />
market at this particular moment.  &#8217; What vou are doing essentially in this<br />
fifth stage is calling uour market together in the headline of your ad. You<br />
are writing an identification headline. You are selling nothing, promising<br />
nothing, satisfying nothing. Instead, you are echoing an emotion,</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>an attitude, a ^satisfaction that picks people out from the crowd and binds<br />
them together in a single statement.  In this type of headline, you are<br />
telling them what thev are You are defining them for themselves. You are<br />
giving them the information they need and want, about a problem still so<br />
vague that you are the first to put it into words.  Here, above all, is the<br />
type of headline that never attempts to sell a product or a performance,<br />
but simplv tries to sell the remainder of the ad itself—the information<br />
that follows on the page. The only function of this headline is to get the<br />
prospect to read the next paragraph. And this second paragraph pulls him<br />
into the third; and the third into the fourth: and right on down the page,<br />
paragraph after paragraph.  Meanwhile these paragraphs are building a steady<br />
progression of logical images, from the first identification with&#8217;the headline,<br />
to a growing awareness of the problem or the desire to the realization that a<br />
solution is at hand, and to the inevitable focussing of that desire and that<br />
solution onto your particular product.  This, then, is the general strategy<br />
of dealing with an unaware market. The application of this strategy, when<br />
all direct methods have failed, has produced hundreds of great headlines. It<br />
would be impossible to classify all of them, since each solution establishes<br />
its own new pattern. However, there are definite landmarks and directions we<br />
can distinguish. Here are some of them—starting with the general principle<br />
they used, then the problem thev solved, then the headline itself, and then<br />
the most important structural paragraph of body copy:</p>

<p><span class="caps">WITHIN</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CURVE</span> OF A WOMAN&#8217;S <span class="caps">ARM</span> A frank discussion of a subject too<br />
often avoided.  A woman&#8217;s arm! Poets have sung of its grace: artists have<br />
painted its beautv.  It should be the daintiest, sweetest thing in the world.<br />
And vet, unfortunatelv. it isn&#8217;t, alwavs.  There&#8217;s an old offender in this<br />
quest for perfect daintiness—an offender of which we ourselves niav be<br />
ever so unconscious, but which is just as truly present.  Shall we discuss<br />
it frankly?  Many a woman who savs, &#8220;No, I am never annoved by perspiration,&#8221;<br />
does not know the facts . . .  Of course, we aren&#8217;t to blame because nature<br />
has made us so that the perspiration glands under the arms are more active<br />
than anywhere else. Nor are we to blame because . . .  have made normal<br />
evaporation there impossible.  Would you be absolutely sure of your daintiness?<br />
It is the chemicals of the body, not uncleanliness, that cause odor. And even<br />
though there is no active perspiration—no apparent moisture—there may be<br />
under the arms an o d o r . . .  Fastidious women who want to be absolutely<br />
sure of their daintiness have found that thev could not trust to their own<br />
consciousness; they have felt the need of a toilet water which would insure<br />
them against any of this kind of underarm unpleasantness, either moisture<br />
or odor.  To meet this need, a physician formulated Odorono— a perfectly<br />
harmless and delightful toilet water . . .</p>
<p>To Project a Hidden Desire Which Cannot Be Put Bluntly Into Words Problem: To<br />
capitalize on research findings that smoking cigarettes gives men a feeling of<br />
virilitv, importance, sexual strength.  Any verbal expression of these themes,<br />
however, would be instantly rejected as absurd and offensive. The solution:<br />

Greater Market Than the Direct Statement of the Solution of That Resentment<br />
Would Produce Problem: To sell a do-it-yourself book on television repairs.<br />
Although all owners of TV sets were the potential market, only a small fraction<br />
considered themselves interested enough or capable enough to respond to a<br />
direct promise headline: &#8220;Save up to $100 a year on your TV repairs!&#8221; Most were<br />
afraid thev could not make the repairs themselves. Therefore, the market must<br />
be broadened to include the nonhandvmen owners, bv exploiting the existing<br />
resentment against TV s e n i c e contracts. The solution: <span class="caps">WHY</span> HAVEN&#8217;T TV<br />
<span class="caps">OWNERS</span> <span class="caps">BEEN</span> <span class="caps">TOLD</span> <span class="caps">THESE</span> <span class="caps">FACTS</span> Was your set purchased after the spring of<br />

get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you&#8217;ve dreamed about!  How many times<br />
this week have you had to get up to fix a jumpy TV picture? . . . How many<br />
times have you had to put up with ghosts? . . .  90% of These Breakdowns<br />
Are Unnecessary!  All these breakdowns mav have seemed tragic to vou at<br />
the moment they happened—but here is the real tragedy! Do you know that<br />
the same exact set that vou now have in your front room . . . has been<br />
playing in manufacturer&#8217;s test rooms for months—and playing perfectly!<br />
These sets have been subjected to &#8220;Breakdown Tests&#8221; . . . These sets have<br />
been tested against every conceivable type of viewing hazard . . . And,<br />
in almost everyone of these cases, these sets have produced perfect, movie-</p>

<p>clear pictures, without major breakdowns, for as much as one full vear! Here<br />
are some of the reasons why: What TV Experts Have Learned About Your Set.<br />
If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were . . . it need break<br />
down only once during the entire year . . .  If your set were properly cared<br />
for, it can actually give you perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364<br />
days of the year . . .  And most important, these experts have discovered<br />
that you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this<br />
performance . . . Here&#8217;s why: 5 Minutes a Week for Perfect Reception.<br />
These TV experts have discovered that your TV set is a great deal like your<br />
bod}&#8217; in this respect—that it gives warning signals before it has a major<br />
breakdown . . .  Now, if you had the knowledge to make a few minor adjustments,<br />
on the outside controls of that set, then you could correct those symptoms<br />
. . .  If you do not have this knowledge . . . then your set will weaken,<br />
you will have a constantly bad picture . . .  It&#8217;s as simple as that. You<br />
pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge. If you had<br />
that knowledge yourself—then you would not have to pav him at all . . .&#8217;<br />
Now suppose that you had a TV expert at your elbow 24 hours a day. Suppose<br />
that every time your set began to flicker, or jump . . . this expert would<br />
show you exactly what knob on the outside of vour set vou could turn . . .<br />
Suppose that every time you were annoyed bv ghosts . . . this expert would<br />
show you a simple nonmechanical trick . . .  Yes, and suppose that even when<br />
your set went black, this expert could show you . . .  All the Information<br />

Arthur had just played &#8220;The Rosarv.&#8221; The room rang with applause. I decided<br />

of all my friends, I strode confidently over to the piano and sat down.<br />
&#8220;Jack is up to his old tricks,&#8221; somebody chuckled. The crowd laughed . . .<br />
&#8220;Can he really play?&#8221; I heard a girl whisper to Arthur.  &#8220;Heavens, no!&#8221; Arthur<br />

. . . I heard gasps of amazement. My friends sat breathless—spellbound.<br />
I played on and on and as I plaved I forgot the people around me. I forgot<br />
the hour, the place, the breathless listeners. The little world I lived<br />

more charm or grace or loveliness than she.  And as her birthdays crept<br />
gradually toward that tragic thirtv-mark, marriage seemed farther from her<br />

<p>That&#8217;s the insidious thing about halitosis (unpleasant breath). You, yourself<br />
rarely know when vou have it. And even your closest friends won&#8217;t tell vou.<br />
Sometimes, of course, halitosis comes from some deepseated organic disorder<br />
that requires professional advice.  But usually—and fortunately—halitosis<br />
is onlv a local condition that yields to the regular use of Listerine as<br />
a mouth wash and gargle. It is an interesting thing that this wellknown<br />

these unusual properties as a breath deodorant&#8230;  Projecting the Result<br />
of an Accomplishment to Attract People Who Would Be Frightened Away by<br />
the Work Implied to Achieve It Problem: To broaden the market for home<br />
correspondence courses, beyond that possible with a direct statement of the<br />
immediate result—learning or skill. An attempt must be made to direct the<br />
prospect&#8217;s mind away from effort, to reward. The solution: &#8220;HERE&#8217;S AN <span class="caps">EXTRA</span><br />

Ends Every day new solutions, new patterns are being created.  Wherever the<br />
direct appeal fails, or loses its power, you should begin to explore a<br />
fifth stage headline.  However, there are two vital points to remember in<br />
connection with this problem. First of all, this type of headline is in-</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">PROS</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>35</p>
<p>finitely more difficult to bring home to the target than any of the other<br />
four types. You are far more likely to miss the mark on this headline, because<br />
you have far fewer guideposts to direct you.  Your headline no longer refers<br />
to i/our product, but it must therefore refer even more strongly to your<br />
market. It cannot simply be a startler, or an attention-getter, or humorous,<br />
or cute. Nor can it mask the fact that it has no headline behind a prettv<br />
picture. Most copy writers use a fifth stage problem to write an empty<br />
headline, and are therefore simply wasting their client&#8217;s money.  Because it<br />
is so easy to wander off into an irrelevant headline, keep this one cardinal<br />
rule in mind. Your prospect must identify with your headline before lie can<br />
buy from it. It must be his headline, his problem, his state of mind at that<br />
particular moment. It must pick out the product&#8217;s logical prospects—and<br />
reject as many people as it attracts.  And, if it is an effective headline,<br />
and it works, then it too will become outdated as your market moves on to a<br />
new stage of awareness. And you will be presented with another problem, just<br />
as challenging, and just as rewarding, as the one you have solved before. You<br />
never step in the same river twice. No market ever stands still.  A Final<br />
Word on Style in Advertising Copy Markets change; desires change; fashions<br />
change. And so do the acceptable styles of advertisements change. Certain<br />
advertising styles—the form your advertising message takes—grow tired<br />
with time—then stale—then actually laughable. At the turn of the century,<br />
effective ads were written in verse; twenty years later, no one would believe<br />
them. In the 1920s most of the great ads were narrative stories—either<br />
first-person confessions, or third person revelations, or comic strips<br />
dramatizations. Today everything but the comic strip is gone—and we see less<br />
and less of it every year. When a new style is born, people believe it, and it</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">STATE</span> OF <span class="caps">AWARENESS</span></p>
<p>reinforces the message it is carrying. When that same style grows trite,<br />
people cannot see the message for the advertisement.  We&#8217;ll explore this<br />
subject further, in the chapters discussing Mood and Disguise in writing<br />
advertisements. Meanwhile, one more note here.  In effective advertising,<br />
though stvles may change, strategydoes not. If you will study the piano and<br />
bridesmaid ads in this chapter, you will notice this: That while the narrative<br />
style of both is now old-hat, you can still respond to their power. Both<br />
tap desires that still exist—though now perhaps directed toward different<br />
products and different problems. And both evoke those desires, and channel<br />
those desires, so effectively, that if they were rewritten in today&#8217;s idiom,<br />
and applied to different products, they still might sell millions of dollars<br />
worth of goods today.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span>: <span class="caps">HOW</span> <span class="caps">MANY</span> <span class="caps">PRODUCTS</span> <span class="caps">HAVE</span> B E E N <span class="caps">THERE</span><br />
<span class="caps">BEFORE</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span>?</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, in Chapter 2, there are three questions vou must answer<br />
before vou can determine what goes into vour headline. These are: 1. What is<br />
the mass desire that motivates your market?  2. How much does your market<br />
know about your product?  (Their State of Awareness.)  3. How many similar<br />
products have they been told about before? (Their State of Sophistication.)<br />
This third question is the most easilv answered. A few hours research should<br />
give you samples of everv competing ad in the field—if there are any.<br />
If You Are First in Your Market If there are not—if vou are the first in<br />
your particular market, with your particular product—then you are dealing<br />
with prospects 37</p>
<p>•JO</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>that have no sophistication about your product at all. In other words, thev<br />
have never received any information about such a product before. Once you get<br />
them interested, they are likelv to become much more enthusiastic, believe<br />
much more of what you have to say, and buy that much more readily. Remember,<br />
vour story is brand-new to them.  This, of course, is the dream of every<br />
manufacturer and every copy writer. To be first. And it happens quite often<br />
today. Sometimes because of a technological breakthrough—creating a new<br />
product (women&#8217;s hair sprays), or a radically better product (longplaying<br />
records), or a familiar product at an explosively low price (the Model T<br />
Ford).  And sometimes, such a brand-new market is created by the insight of<br />
an advertising man, dealing with an already-established product. In this case,<br />
the ad man visualizes the application of the product to an entirely different<br />
market (the switch, in the Twenties, of Ovaltine from an aid for insomnia<br />
to a body builder for skinnv children).  Or he reaches that market through a<br />
hitherto untapped medium (Revlons fabulous results from sponsorship of &#8220;The<br />
$64,000 Question&#8221; in the early days of TV).  Or he discovers a previously<br />
unnoticed performance of his product that carries it completely beyond the<br />
limits of its old market (Lifebuoy&#8217;s discovery that people would accept its<br />
strong medicinal odor as a cure for perspiration odor, and their subsequent<br />
christening of that odor with the catch-word &#8220;B.O.&#8221;).  When such a golden<br />
opportunity—to be first—presents itself, you are probably dealing with<br />
a market in its third or fourth stage of awareness. Your prospects know that<br />
they would like what your product does, or they would like to get rid of the<br />
problem your product solves—if it were only possible.  Here, the answer<br />
to your third question is quite simple. You are dealing with a market where<br />
you are first. Therefore thev have no previous information about similar<br />
products. Therefore they are completely unsophisticated.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>And vour exploitation of this answer—your strategy in approaching this<br />
market—is equally simple: 1. Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don&#8217;t<br />
be fancy. &#8216;Same either the need or the claim in your headline—nothing<br />
more. Dramatize that claim in your copy—make it as powerful as possible.<br />
And. then bring in your product; and prove that it works.  Nothing<br />
more—because nothing more is needed. To illustrate, let&#8217;s look at one of<br />
the most profitable, insatiable, constantlyrenewing, and therefore overworked<br />
fields in marketing history: the reducing field. No one knows who was the<br />
first man to stumble on the reducing field (though it&#8217;s fairly certain that<br />
he must have become a millionaire). But all he had to say in his headline<br />
as a simple statement of the direct desire of millions of women: w:</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">NOW</span>! <span class="caps">LOSE</span> <span class="caps">UGLY</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span>!&#8221;  As he started to clean up, others inevitably<br />
followed. But, by this time, the reducing field had already been<br />
tapped. Advertisements had been run. The direct claim had been made. Mere<br />
repetition would no longer be enough. In other words, the reducing market was<br />
now in its Second Stage of Sophistication. A new approach was necessary. The<br />
strategy had to be changed—to this:</p>
<p>If You&#8217;re Second, Do This If you&#8217;re second, and the direct claim is still<br />
working—then copy that successful claim—but enlarge on it. Drive it<br />
to the absolute limit. Outbid your competition.  For example, here are two<br />
successful headlines in the now fiercelv-competitive reducing field that did<br />
just that. They have both been pushed to the outer limits of both legality<br />
and believabilitv. But thev both worked.  &#8217;LOSE UP TO 47 <span class="caps">POUNDS</span> IN 4 <span class="caps">WEEKSOR</span><br />

<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I AM 61 <span class="caps">POUNDS</span> <span class="caps">LIGHTER</span> . . . <span class="caps">NEVER</span> A <span class="caps">HUNGRY</span> <span class="caps">MINUTE</span>.&#8221;  In most fields,<br />
this enlarged-claim technique reaches the outer limits in successive<br />
stages. Sometimes the completion of this process takes years. In the home<br />
garden field, as another example, an advertiser brought out a Floribunda<br />
Rose—using this headline with startling success: &#8220;<span class="caps">PICK</span> 25—50—100 <span class="caps">ROSES</span><br />
<span class="caps">FROM</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">MAGNIFICENT</span> <span class="caps">PLANT</span>!&#8221;  It worked. And so, some years later,<br />
a special variety of cushion mum swept the country with this headline: &#8220;<span class="caps">SIX</span><br />
<span class="caps">HUNDRED</span> <span class="caps">MUMS</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> A <span class="caps">SINGLE</span> <span class="caps">BUSH</span>!&#8221;  And, one year later, this headline carried<br />
the process to what are probably the absolute limits of Mother Nature: &#8220;<span class="caps">WHO</span><br />
<span class="caps">EVER</span> <span class="caps">HEARD</span> OF 17,000 <span class="caps">BLOOMS</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> A <span class="caps">SINGLE</span> <span class="caps">PLANT</span>?&#8221;  As simple as this evolution<br />
looks, it produces results. It provided a tremendous lift to car sales in<br />
the 1950s, when 50 more horsepower was added to the advertisements everv<br />
vear. It was climaxed in the Chrysler 300—a car named after its horsepower<br />
rating—and pegged just at the limit of believability, practicality, and<br />
the inevitable public reaction.  For the reaction will come. Toward the end,<br />
the process disintegrates. The successful claim is overworked; enlargement<br />
piles on enlargement. New competitors enter the field—each trying to<br />
promise more. Headlines double and triple in size. Words begin to lose their<br />
meaning—&quot;whiter-than-whites&quot; appear. The prospect becomes confused—then<br />
skeptical. Believability is shattered; claims are automatically discounted<br />
50% by their readers. More promise is poured in to compensate. The govern-</p>

<p>41</p>
<p>merit begins to investigate. And the sales curve begins to turn down-down-down.<br />
The Third Stage of Sophistication At this point, your market has entered<br />
into its Third Stage of Sophistication. Your prospects have now heard all<br />
the claims— all the extremes. Perhaps they have even bought one or two<br />
competitive products. Every time they open a newspaper, another similar<br />
headline screams out at them. How are they to distinguish one product from the<br />
mass? How do you break through to reach them?  One factor is vital here. That<br />
is the restorative power of the market you are dealing with. It may be a<br />
market based on a constantly recurring mass instinct, such as reducing. It<br />
may be a market based on an unsolved technological problem, such as spark plug<br />
replacement. It may be a market that periodically wishes to renew or improve<br />
its purchases, such as cars, homes, appliances.  In all these cases, the<br />
desire never fades; the market continuallv renews itself. New prospects come<br />
into the market. Old customers become dissatisfied with their old purchases,<br />
their old solutions, and begin to look again. The mass desire—the tremendous<br />
profit potential—still exists. But it cannot be tapped by the old, simple<br />
methods any longer.  Women still want to lose weight. But by now they&#8217;ve read<br />
dozens of ads for reducing aids—all promising them to take off 20, 30,<br />
40 pounds in a matter of weeks. They no longer fully believe them. Perhaps<br />
the}&#8217; believe these ads so little that they won&#8217;t even try a new product<br />
at all. For months, even years, they may simplv accept their overweight<br />
condition as &#8220;something that just can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;  But the desire never<br />
fades. The dissatisfaction builds up, month after month. Secretly, perhaps<br />
even unconsciously, these women are hoping to find a new product—a new<br />
headline—that promises them a new way to satisfy that age-old desire.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>And on this fundamental fact, we build our strategy for selling a market<br />
in its Third Stage of Sophistication.  If your market is at the stage where<br />
they&#8217;ve heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or<br />
exaggeration wont work any longer. What this market needs now is a new device<br />
to make all these old claims become fresh and believable to them again. In<br />
other words, A <span class="caps">NEW</span> MECHANISM—a new way to making the old promise work. A<br />
different process—a fresh chance—a brand-new possibility of success where<br />
only disappointment has resulted before.  Here the emphasis shifts from what<br />
the product does to <span class="caps">HOW</span> it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes<br />
dominant. The headline expands. The claim remains—but now it is reinforced<br />
by the mechanism that accomplishes it. In the reducing field, for example,<br />
the limits of its basic promise had been reached bv headlines like this:<br />
&#8220;I AM 61 <span class="caps">POUNDS</span> <span class="caps">LIGHTER</span> . . . <span class="caps">NEVER</span> A <span class="caps">HUNGRY</span> <span class="caps">MINUTE</span>.&#8221;  Now new leaders<br />
emerge—avoiding the competition of claims—stressing mechanism instead,<br />
like this: &#8220;<span class="caps">FLOATS</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span> <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BODY</span>!&#8221;  ft ft ft</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">FIRST</span> <span class="caps">WONDER</span> <span class="caps">DRUG</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">REDUCING</span>!&#8221;  A vital change has taken place in both<br />
these ads—and in every ad that deals successfully with this Third Stage of<br />
Sophistication. In the previous, Second-Stage ads, the entire headline was<br />
taken up by a complete statement of the main claim. Below it, in smaller type,<br />
in either a subhead or the bodv copy, came the mechanism that accomplished<br />
the claim. Often, this mechanism was abbreviated—simply mentioned instead<br />
of being explained—indicated bv a sort of shorthand, like this:</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>43</p>
<p>&#8220;I AM 61 <span class="caps">POUNDS</span> <span class="caps">LIGHTER</span> . . . <span class="caps">NEVER</span> A <span class="caps">HUNGRY</span> <span class="caps">MINUTE</span>.&#8217;  Read the Astonishing<br />
Experience of New York Food Expert with the Famous Eat-and-Redtice Plan.<br />
In Third-Stage ads, however, this arrangement is completely reversed. By<br />
this time, the basic claim has become well-known to almost all its<br />
prospects—perhaps even too well-known. Therefore, this shorthand can be<br />
applied to the claim itself. What was before a five to ten word headline<br />
describing nothing but the basic claim—&#8221;I AM 61 P O U N D S LIGHTER&quot;—Hint-<br />
can he communicated in a single word in a headline devoted to explaining how<br />
this claim is accomplished. For instance: &#8220;<span class="caps">FLOATS</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span> <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BODY</span>!&#8221;<br />
Or: &#8220;<span class="caps">FIRST</span> <span class="caps">WONDER</span> <span class="caps">DRUG</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">REDUCING</span>!&#8221;  First the mechanism is brought into the<br />
headline to establish a point of difference—to make the old claims fresh and<br />
believable again. And then—once the prospect is told that here is a brandnew<br />
chance for success—then the claim can he restated in full, to make sure that<br />
she realizes everything she is getting. Like this: &#8220;<span class="caps">FLOATS</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span> <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> OF<br />
<span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BODY</span>!&#8221;  Released for the first time! The amazing scientific discoverv<br />
that melts up to 37 <span class="caps">POUNDS</span> off men and women— without starvation diets,<br />
without a single hungry moment— without even giving up the foods you love!<br />
Or—using the same Third-Stage arrangement of mechanism in the headline,<br />
and claim elaborated in the lead paragraph—we have this ad:</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">FIRST</span> <span class="caps">WONDER</span> <span class="caps">DRUG</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">REDUCING</span>!&#8221;  Used successfully by thousands<br />
of phvsicians! Lose as many pounds as you like without diets, without<br />
exercise, without giving up the kinds of food vou love to eat!  In both these<br />
ads—and all others like them—the promise itself is subordinated to the<br />
mechanism which accomplishes that promise. This mechanism is featured in<br />
the headline. When ads such as these are successful, you are dealing with a<br />
market that is in its Third Stage of Sophistication.  The Fourth Stage But<br />
you are still in a competitive market, and such ads give only a temporary<br />
advantage. Such ads, presenting a new promise, begin a new trend. Within a<br />
few months, the Third Stage of Sophistication passes into a Fourth Stage—a<br />
new stage of elaboration and enlargement. But this time, the elaboration is<br />
concentrated on the mechanism, rather than on the promise—like this: &#8220;<span class="caps">FIRST</span><br />
NO-<span class="caps">DIET</span> <span class="caps">REDUCING</span> <span class="caps">WONDER</span> <span class="caps">DRUG</span>!&#8221;  This Fourth Stage strategy can be summarized<br />
like this: If a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve<br />
the same claim as that performed by your product, and that new-mechanism<br />
announcement is producing sales, then you counter in this way. Simply elaborate<br />
or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer;<br />
allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations; promise<br />
extra benefits. You are beginning a stage of embellishment similar to the<br />
Second Stage of Sophistication described above. The same strategy will be<br />
effective here.  But, unfortunately, so will the same limitations. The Fourth</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> O F <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Stage of Sophistication, like the Second Stage which it resembles, eventually<br />
pushes itself out of the realm of believabilitv. At this point, further<br />
elaborations become ineffective. You are then faced with two alternatives:<br />
First, discovering a new, acceptable mechanism to make the promise fresh and<br />
believable again. But remember, the mechanism vou use must not only be new<br />
and legitimate, but it must be accepted as believable and significant by<br />
vour market. Each Third and Fourth Stage ad that precedes you, makes this<br />
problem of acceptance more and more difficult.  Eventually, of course,<br />
no new mechanism will gain acceptance. The market will have grown tired<br />
of your promises and the mechanisms bv which thev are accomplished. Your<br />
prospects will have been glutted bv advertising. You will have reached the<br />
Fifth Stage of Sophistication—the most difficult—where the field is said<br />
to be exhausted—where competitors are dropping out of the market en masse.<br />
How to Revive a &#8220;Dead&#8221; Product In this Final Stage of Sophistication, your<br />
market no longer believes in your advertising, and therefore no longer wishes<br />
to he aware of your product. In many ways, therefore, this Fifth Stage<br />
of Sophistication corresponds to the Fifth Stage of Awareness discussed<br />
in Chapter 2. The problems are the same. The strategy is the same. The<br />
emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it,<br />
to identification with the prospect himself. You are dealing here with the<br />
problem of bringing your prospect into your ad—not through desire—but<br />
through identification. (See Chapter 8.)  An outstanding example of a product<br />
which had lost its market because of such a Fifth Stage of Sophistication,<br />
and then gained it back by a brilliant use of the identification headline, is<br />
the Postum ad discussed in Chapter 2, and its headline, &#8220;<span class="caps">WHY</span> <span class="caps">MEN</span> <span class="caps">CRACK</span> . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> O F <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">THE</span></p>
<p>SOI&#8217;HI</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s Look at an Industry That Went Through All Five Stages of Sophistication<br />
But perhaps the classic example of an industry which encountered all five<br />
Stages of Sophistication—and overcame them— is the Cigarette Industry. The<br />
history of cigarette advertising is a continuous battle against competition,<br />
against physical and social taboos, even against the very success of its own<br />
current advertising; which saturates and exhausts the market bv the weight of<br />
its combined industry expenditures, and constantly demands new approaches.<br />
Let&#8217;s briefly examine the main current of cigarette advertising first—the<br />
progression from the first to the fifth Stages of Sophistication—and then<br />
discuss some of the side problems it encountered.  In the First Stage of<br />
Sophistication, when the market was new, cigarette advertising featured<br />
taste, enjoyment, pleasure in the headline: &#8220;I&#8217;D <span class="caps">WALK</span> A <span class="caps">MILE</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> A <span class="caps">CAMEL</span>!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;CHESTERFIELD—THEY <span class="caps">SATISFY</span>!&#8221;  This raw promise of enjoyment gradually became<br />
elaborated and embellished to push it to the limits of believabilitv. In<br />
this Second Stage, since you cannot measure the pleasure a cigarette gives<br />
you, the promise-growth took the form of broader and broader comparisons:<br />
&#8220;<span class="caps">LIGHT</span> UP A <span class="caps">LUCKY</span>, <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">WONT</span> <span class="caps">MISS</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SWEETS</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> <span class="caps">MAKE</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span>!&#8221;<br />
But, without measurement, the limits of enlargement are soon reached. So<br />
Third-Stage strategy began to be emploved—a continuous stream of brilliant<br />
new mechanisms: &#8220;LUCKIES—THEY&#8217;RE <span class="caps">TOASTED</span>!&#8221;</p>
<p>and hciiai:</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>4I</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">PALL</span> MALL&#8217;S <span class="caps">GREATER</span> <span class="caps">LENGTH</span> <span class="caps">FILTERS</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SMOKE</span> <span class="caps">FURTHER</span>!&#8221;  &#8220;CAMELS—PROTECT<br />
<span class="caps">YOUR</span> T-<span class="caps">ZONE</span>!&#8221;  And, as each of these mechanisms was accepted bv the buying<br />
public, the originators competitors adopted the mechanism and began<br />
to elaborate on it—initiating the Fourth Stage: &#8220;<span class="caps">PHILIP</span> MORRIS—ALL<br />
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HARSHNESS</span> <span class="caps">BAKED</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span>!&#8221;  &#8220;CHESTERFIELD—REGULAR <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">KING</span>-<span class="caps">SIZED</span> <span class="caps">TOO</span>!&#8221;<br />

lost their potency, and the government ruled out the health claims; and<br />
in the early Fifties the industry faced a Fifth Stage market. But a new<br />
marketing tool—Motivation Research—had shown them how to reach this<br />
market without mechanisms or claims, without even headlines, simply by<br />
projecting strong visual identifications with the virility that the public<br />
had accepted in a cigarette. For example, anv of the Marlboro &#8220;Virile Men&#8221;<br />
ads. Or their imitations in Chesterfield, or Camel ads.  Thus we have the<br />
full spectrum of sophistication confronting an industry. But cigarette<br />
advertisers also encountered two critical side problems. The first offered<br />
them the opportunity of doubling their market. The second, of retaining that<br />
huge market in the face of the most adverse publicity The first challenge<br />
occurred immediately following the First World War. By this time the old<br />
&#8220;Coffin Nails&#8221; taboo had been forgotten—for men. But there still remained<br />
the equally great potential market of women smokers—if smoking could be<br />
made respectable for women. The trend was definitely in that direction—<br />
the urge, the curiosity existed in millions of women in all social</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> O F <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>classes—.some respectable women were actually daring to smoke in public.<br />
But the trend—left by itself—would take years to develop. An advertisement<br />
had to be created to accelerate that trend. To make smoking for women not only<br />
acceptable, but desirable. To channel the vast movement toward liberation and<br />
equality of the Twenties as the driving force to open up this huge new market.<br />
But such an advertisement could never come right out and suggest that women<br />
smoke. It could not even show a woman smoking. Such an advertisement was<br />
definitely a Fifth Stage problem—a problem in identification. And it was<br />
solved by linking a man and woman in their most appealing connection—in love<br />
with a smoking situation. The ad showed a young couple, sitting together on a<br />
beach on a moonlit night. He is just lighting up a cigarette—the first puffs<br />
of smoke are just drifting into the moonlight. She has her face turned toward<br />
his, and her words make up the entire headline (and, except for the logo,<br />
the entire ad): &#8220;<span class="caps">BLOW</span> <span class="caps">SOME</span> MY <span class="caps">WAV</span>.&#8221;  Nothing more needed to be said. A vast<br />
new market—opened up with four words.  The second challenge occurred thirty<br />
vears later. This was the cancer scare of the late Fifties, which continues<br />
into today It resulted in four reactions: First, there were cigarette holders,<br />
water pipes, ceramic filters, etc.—none of which succeeded in establishing<br />
a national market, since they represented too much inconvenience, too blatant<br />
an admission that the purchaser was worried about his smoking.  Secondly,<br />
the scare produced a determined effort in the industry itself to conduct<br />
its own research, to counteract or correct such claims.  Third, it produced<br />
a temporary drop in cigarette sales.  And, fourth, it opened up a vast new<br />
market for an already</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">SOPHISTICATION</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">MARKET</span></p>
<p>49</p>
<p>existing product—the filter cigarette—aided by the industry itself, which<br />
wisely gambled that smokers would not move out of cigarettes, but simply into a<br />
different kind of cigarette.  Filter cigarettes had always existed, as a small,<br />
specialty market. But now they were expanded into a mass market. Millions of<br />
new prospects, who had never before even considered filter cigarettes, now<br />
sought out information about them, asked to be told which one to b u y A new<br />
market opened up. And it started to retrace the same Stages of Sophistication<br />
as its parent market had passed through fifty years before: First Stage:<br />

an industry-wide stroke of genius— right back to the flavor again: &#8220;<span class="caps">WINSTON</span><br />

<p>And so it goes. In industry after industry. The same life cycle for each<br />
market. The same deadly challenges. The same willingness to adapt rather<br />
than perish.</p>
<p>A Personal Note In this book I have tried to write a scientific study of<br />
advertising, without troubling the reader with whatever personal ethics<br />
I myself may observe. Every copv writer who has ever sweated for days to<br />
create a new approach will know how it feels to see that approach copied<br />
overnight bv a competitor. I share every ounce of that feeling. But such<br />
events happen every day. And they are effective. Therefore, examples such<br />
as those detailed above must be listed, in all objectivitv, as a business<br />
strategy that has and will solve competitive problems in a competitive<br />
industry. I include them here—not as recommendations, but as possible<br />
strategies to be chosen or rejected.</p>
<p>4 38 <span class="caps">WAYS</span> TO <span class="caps">STRENGTHEN</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">HEADLINE</span> <span class="caps">ONCE</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BASIC</span> <span class="caps">IDEA</span></p>
<p>Up to this point, we have been concerned with the strategy of planning<br />
copv—of arriving at the theme of our ad and the content of its<br />
headline—rather than with the techniques of actually writing this copy. The<br />
entire second portion of the book will be devoted to these techniques.  But we<br />
must pause now, and examine one of these techniques out of sequence. It<br />
is called <span class="caps">VERBALIZATION</span>. And it is the art of increasing the impact of a<br />
headline bi/ the way in which it is stated.  Everything we have done so far<br />
lias helped us obtain the content of our headline. We now know what we want<br />
to say. And we now have to determine how to sav it.  The most obvious wav,<br />
of course, is simplv to state the claim in its barest form. &#8220;Lose Weight,&#8221; or<br />
&#8220;Stop Corns.&#8221; for example.  And if you are the first in vour field, there is<br />
no better wav.  But where vou are competitive, or where the thought is too 51</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>38 <span class="caps">WAYS</span> TO S T R E N G T H E N <span class="caps">YOUR</span> H E A D L I N E</p>
<p>complicated to be stated simply and directly, then you must reinforce that<br />
claim by binding other images to it with the words in which you express<br />
it. This is Verbalization. And it can accomplish several different purposes:<br />
1. It can strengthen the claim—bv enlarging upon it, by measuring it,<br />
by making it more vivid, etc.  2. It can make the claim new and fresh<br />
again—bv twisting it, changing it, presenting it from a different angle,<br />
turning it into a narration, challenging the reader with an example, etc.<br />
3. It can help the claim pull the prospect into the body of the ad—by<br />
promising him information about it, bv questioning him, by partially<br />
revealing mechanism, etc.  All of these goals are accomplished by adding<br />
variations, enlargements or embellishments to the main headline claim<br />
of the ad. These additional images are bound into the main claim bv the<br />
sentence structure of the headline. Thev alter the main claim to make it<br />
more effective.  They are the second creative step in writing the ad. First,<br />
we have seen how to determine the appeal itself. And now, howto shape that<br />
appeal into its most effective form in the headline.  There are, of course,<br />
an infinite number of these variations (every good copywriter invents a few<br />
himself). But there are general patterns that most of them follow. Here are<br />
some of these guideposts for vour own thinking: 1. Measure the size of the<br />
claim: &#8220;20,000 <span class="caps">FILTER</span> <span class="caps">TRAPS</span> IN <span class="caps">VICEROY</span>!&#8221;  &#8220;I AM 61 <span class="caps">POUNDS</span> <span class="caps">LIGHTER</span> . . .&#8221;<br />

Compare<br />
the claim: &#8220;<span class="caps">SIX</span> <span class="caps">TIMES</span> <span class="caps">WHITER</span> <span class="caps">WASHES</span>!&#8221;  &#8220;<span class="caps">COSTS</span> UP TO $300 <span class="caps">LESS</span> <span class="caps">THAN</span> <span class="caps">MANY</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="caps">MELTS</span> <span class="caps">AWAY</span> <span class="caps">UGLY</span> <span class="caps">FAT</span>!&#8221;  5. Sensitize the claim bv making the prospect feel,<br />
smell, touch, see or hear it: &#8220;<span class="caps">TASTES</span> <span class="caps">LIKE</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">JUST</span> <span class="caps">PICKED</span> IT!&#8221;  &#8220;<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SKIN</span><br />
<span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">LOVE</span> TO <span class="caps">TOUCH</span>!&#8221;  6. Demonstrate the claim bv showing a prime example:<br />
&#8220;<span class="caps">JAKE</span> <span class="caps">LAMOTTA</span>, 160 <span class="caps">POUND</span> <span class="caps">FIGHTER</span>, <span class="caps">FAILS</span> TO <span class="caps">FLATTEN</span> <span class="caps">MONO</span> <span class="caps">PAPER</span> <span class="caps">CUP</span>!&#8221;  &#8220;AT 60<br />

<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at a few special headline problems, and then sum up:</p>
<p>The Three Levels of Creativity Something should be said here about the<br />
various approaches copy writers use to dig up a new headline. As far as I<br />
can tell, there are three of them: The first, the shallowest, and the most<br />
widespread and ineffective, is the Word-Substitute Technique. Here the<br />
copy writer consults a list of proven and successful headlines. He then<br />
pulls out the original product name and substitutes his own; or his own<br />
product&#8217;s performance, etc. He usually comes up with something like this:<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;D <span class="caps">WALK</span> A <span class="caps">MILE</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> A <span class="caps">CUP</span> OF <span class="caps">BLANK</span> <span class="caps">COFFEE</span>!&#8221;  59</p>

<span class="caps">RIGHT</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> OF <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">SKIN</span>!&#8221;  If these ads are copied from a similar product,<br />
in the same market, at the same time, then their chance of success is good—<br />
especially if they embellish the promise in any way. But if the product, or<br />
the market, or the timing is different, then the chances of success diminish<br />
proportionately They become Echo Ads ads that remind people of some other<br />
product. Thev pav no attention to unique product-market-timing relationship<br />
that exists at the moment. Therefore they lose all the strengths that are<br />
wrapped up in that relationship. They are the kind of ads that clients write,<br />
rather than copy writers.  The second, deeper and more difficult approach<br />
is through formulas. Here the copy writer has memorized a list of rules or<br />
principles, and tries to pour his headline into them like he&#8217;d pour hot lead<br />
into a mold. Such rules usually concern the way a headline is expressed. They<br />
list methods of strengthening the verbalization of the headline idea, and<br />
here thev have a perfectlyvalid use. Several examples of these principles<br />
are given in Chapter 4.  But the idea for an ad or a headline demands its<br />
own shape.  It cannot be fitted into someone else&#8217;s solution. The problem<br />
defies a formula. And the third, analytical approach that we have outlined<br />
above—with no answers; only guide-posts and questions—offers the onlv wav.<br />
This is a hard fact to accept. It means that a solution which has cost you<br />
days and weeks of painful effort, and which has done its job perfectly—can<br />
be used only once. It means that there are no creative shortcuts—that<br />
the effort must be duplicated with each individual ad. But fortunately the<br />
techniques of probing can be learned and perfected; intuition can be sharpened;</p>

<p>Di</p>
<p>a sensitivity can be developed for picking out the vital fact from a maze<br />
of information.  And, of course, abandoning this effort leads to a reality<br />
which is even harsher. Manx&#8217; copy writers grow old, or tired, or afraid.<br />
They stop searching for the unique solution in every problem.  From this<br />
moment on, they begin to copy instead of create. And most pathetic of all,<br />
main&#8217; begin to copy themselves. The more successful the copv writer, the<br />
greater the temptation to find his new headline in his old files.  But it<br />
won&#8217;t work. Copying can be done by any cub. All this process does is bring<br />
talent down to the level of file-cabinet mediocrity. The true copy writer<br />
must argue with success—he must push on past it every time he faces a new<br />
product. In advertising, as well as in science and in art, the solution to<br />
the unique lies only in itself.  On Motivation Research and Its Relation to<br />
the Copy Writer As we have repeated throughout this first part of the book,<br />
the copy writer&#8217;s primary job is to know his market. Many times, he has to<br />
know more about that market than the market knows about itself.  Before MR,<br />
he did this mostly by personal digging, reading, talking—and guessing. With<br />
MR, lie has some pretty professional guessers working with him. And they<br />
have the equipment to prove their guesses far more easily and inexpensively<br />
than writing a campaign and testing it.  The copy writer can use MR in two<br />
ways. It can be a tremendous source of information to him. Information about<br />
the most powerful needs and desires of his market—desires that may be hidden,<br />
verbally unacceptable, or completely unknown.  It shows him the strength of<br />
those desires—their drift and momentum—the taboos that accompany them, and<br />
limit their expression. It helps him locate splits in his market—gauge their</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><span class="caps">SUMMARY</span>: T H E <span class="caps">ART</span> OF <span class="caps">CREATIVE</span> <span class="caps">PLANNING</span></p>
<p>points of difference—design pinpoint appeals for each of them.  And it<br />
feeds back to him early reactions to his own phraseology—to test his own<br />
worry-points in the ad—to enable him to shift emphasis—and even to emerge<br />
with a completely new idea.  All well and good. But a motivation research<br />
finding is not a headline, nor even the central theme of an ad, nor will it<br />
ever be. Like any other fact, it is a direction. First it tells vou where not<br />
to go, to avoid wasting your time. And then it indicates the general area<br />
of your solution.  But the transformation of those facts into an idea, and<br />
the expression of that idea in the strongest possible form, still requires<br />
as much creative talent as any other starting point. The source of an idea,<br />
no matter how profound, is still only the beginning. The copy writer has to<br />
take it from there.  The second great service that MR can perform for the<br />
copywriter is that of testing his own hunches, in answering the questions<br />
he uncovers in dealing with his market over a period of time.  For purposes<br />
of simplicity, we have dealt with advertising strategy as though it always<br />
consisted of writing a single ad— rather than a continuous campaign. By<br />
limiting ourselves in this way, we have been able to deal with each of the<br />
phases of such a campaign as though it were a separate and distinct problem,<br />
requiring a separate and distinct advertisement to solve it. In doing this,<br />
we have emphasized that a breakthrough can occur at any stage of a campaign;<br />
and that the same breakthrough techniques can be used to produce the germ idea<br />
for the entire campaign that follows.  In reality, however, the copy writer<br />
usually works on a given product, or in a given market area, for long periods<br />
of time. During that time he will write many ads on this same subject. And<br />
during that time he will engage in a kind of discourse with his market,<br />
in which he feeds that market ideas, and it feeds back to him reactions to<br />
those ideas.  During this massive conversation, if he is sensitive, the copy</p>

<p>63</p>
<p>writer will pick up a continuous flow of the most vital information. Some<br />
of this information will be actual trends and preferences, which can be<br />
immediately translated into new ads. But much more of it will be in negative<br />
form—failures, roadblocks, limitations to the response from his ads. And<br />
only the statistical measurements of these limitations will be shown—not<br />
their causes.  The copywriter will want to know why they occur. And in asking<br />
whv, he will give birth to questions like these: What causes one woman<br />
to make most of her clothes at home, and another woman to use her sewing<br />
machine only for minor repairs?  How can we convince more people that it&#8217;s<br />
safe to buy through mail order?  Why will men instantlv buy an automatic<br />
potato peeler—and women send it right back to the store again?  These are<br />
research questions. They deal with psychological dimensions. The copv writer<br />
discovers them, and passes them along to his MR people to be phrased, tested<br />
and answered. Thus is born a new idea, a new theme, and a new headline,<br />
perhaps even a new campaign.  On Expressing the Personality of a Product<br />
in Your Headline One of the most potent discoveries of motivation research<br />
is that a product, or a store, or a whole group of products has a distinct<br />
and complete personality to the consumer. This personality is a complex<br />
quality, embracing many traits. In the case of the Cadillac, for example,<br />
it consists of quality, prestige, performance, appearance, comfort, resale<br />
value, freedom from repairs and much more.  But—and this is the important<br />
point to consider in writing vour headline—one of these traits will always<br />
be the most effective in summarizing and expressing this personality. In<br />
the case of Cadillac, it has always been, and will always be, quality. This</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><span class="caps">SUMMARY</span>: T H E <span class="caps">ART</span> OF <span class="caps">CREATIVE</span> <span class="caps">PLANNING</span></p>
<p>summary trait is featured in a series of headlines, or headline<br />
illustrations—perhaps blended with one or two of the other traits to give<br />
it variety but always strengthening those other traits bv interrelating them<br />
to this one dominant quality.  Thus the personality is simplified, symbolized<br />
and sharpened to grasp the reader. And then—as the reader moves on through<br />
the body copy of the ad—this personality is expanded and examined in all<br />
its appeals—an ever-enlarging pyramid of persuasion, drawing in all the<br />
necessary information—charging that information with desire—terminating<br />
inevitably in the one source of satisfaction for that desire—vour product.<br />
We will examine this concept more thoroughly in Chapter 8—on Identification.<br />
On the Only Type of Prevention Headline That Will Sell Many copy writers<br />
believe that no prevention headline (because it treats a problem that may<br />
occur and that is not actually plaguing your prospect at this moment) can<br />
ever be effective.  The reason they give for this failure is the inability of<br />
the prospect to identify himself with a problem that has not already forced<br />
itself upon him.  This is true—but only for those problems which affect him<br />
personally. He is perfectly capable of imagining such problems afflicting his<br />
loved ones, his friends, his wife and children, even his nation. This is why<br />
decay-preventing toothpaste sold so well when the ads focussed the decay, not<br />
on the parent, but on the children. This is why life insurance can be sold,<br />
not by picturing the prospects death, but the horrors inflicted upon his<br />
wife and children if insufficient money is left over to take care of them.<br />
To sum up: A man will not visualize future disasters occurring to himself,<br />
but he is perfectly capable of visualizing, and buying preventatives from,<br />
the image of such future problems affecting others around him.</p>

<p>On the Selection of Splinter Markets to Avoid Competition Throughout this<br />
book, we have assumed that each competitor in a market will trv to advertise<br />
to that market as a whole.  For example, that every reducing aid will try to<br />
sell all women that are interested in losing weight.  This assumption is not<br />
necessarily true, in at least two respects. First, it assumes that such a<br />
market is all of one piece (for example, that all women want to lose weight<br />
for the same reason).  Thev do not, of course. There are at least two major<br />
sub-categories in the market—those who want to lose weight for appearance<br />
reasons, and those who must lose weight because of their health. The same<br />
general appeal—LOSE WEIGHT—will be effective with both. But certainly<br />
the mechanisms should vary—speed and ease in the first—safetv and<br />
permanence in the second.  Secondly, a small company with a limited budget<br />
may avoid competing with larger rivals for the core of the market, and may<br />
concentrate its attack on a smaller segment of that market. This is usually<br />
done regionally. But it may be even more effective if it is based on the<br />
sociology of the market rather than its geography. For example, a reducing<br />
aid may decide to abandon the greater appearance segment of the market, and<br />
appeal much more specifically to the health segment. This deliberate focussing<br />
of the appeal would alter every aspect of the campaign, from the headline,<br />
through identification copy, through mechanism and substantiation—right<br />
down to the selection of media and channels of distribution. (Health and<br />
geriatric magazines, and distribution through doctors rather than drug stores.)<br />
Eventually, of course, if the appeal is successful and the budget grows,<br />
then the advertiser can decide to invade the majority market. If he does<br />
this, the success of the initial limited campaign can be used as a point of<br />
difference to appeal to the larger market. For example, the fact that women<br />
who were forced to lose weight permanently relied on this product more than<br />
twice as often as any other, etc.</p>

<p>In Summary The first five chapters of this book, which vou have just finished,<br />
describe a process which may take days, or weeks, or months to complete.<br />
This process begins with a thorough analysis of the market for your client&#8217;s<br />
product—with an attempt to measure the breadth and depth of that market—to<br />
identify the gigantic emotional forces that create that market—to define<br />
and focus those forces in terms of a single image or desire or need—and to<br />
channel those forces toward one inevitable solution—vour client&#8217;s product.<br />
In order to do this, the second step of this process involves a meticulous<br />
study of the product itself—what it is and what it does—the physical<br />
product that you will deliver, and the functional product that you will<br />
sell—all its various satisfactions and performances—again focussed to<br />
a single image, a single identification, a single claim that will tap the<br />
greatest possible emotional force within your market.  The combination of<br />
these first and second steps gives you the theme of your ad—the desire your<br />
market demands and its satisfaction . . . the need your market feels and its<br />
solution . . . the identification your market gropes for and its expression.<br />
And once you discover this theme, you begin the process of expressing it. You<br />
explore the state of maturity of vour market.  You find out how much people<br />
know about vour product and what it does—how much they&#8217;ve been told about<br />
similar products—and how much they care about both.  Out of this analysis<br />
comes the point of entrv for vour headline—the point of contact—the point<br />
of greatest interest and acceptance on the part of your prospect. It may be<br />
located anywhere—in your product itself, in its price, in its performance,<br />
in the satisfaction your product promises, in the need vour market demands<br />
from your product, or only in the market itself.  But, wherever it is, this<br />
is the point where vou start. Here the searching and the planning stop. Here<br />
the words begin.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SUMMARY</span>: T H E <span class="caps">ART</span> OF <span class="caps">CREATIVE</span> <span class="caps">PLANNING</span></p>
<p>Again, this process may take weeks or even months. And at the end of that<br />
time, you may have written five or ten words.  These five or ten words will<br />
make up about 90% of the value of your ad. If you are right, they may start a<br />
new industry. If you are wrong, nothing you write after them will save your<br />
ad. Copy writing—on the idea level—is an all or nothing profession. You<br />
build your idea, piece by piece . . . you crowd it into five or ten words<br />
. . . and then it stands or dies by itself. And everything that follows<br />
it, stands or dies with it. This is why we have devoted so much time to<br />
this planning process.  And it is a process. You don&#8217;t get an idea or a<br />
headline— vou either build it, or vou unfold it, petal by petal. You dig<br />
it out of the market research . . . vou wring it out of the product . . .<br />
you read, you listen, you experiment for yourself. You work— hard. You<br />
rub up against this product and this market so hard that they seep into<br />
vour pores. And—above everything else—you remember this cardinal ride of<br />
creativity: What you are looking for in this product and this market is the<br />
one element that makes them unique. The idea you want— the headline you<br />
want—the breakthrough you want—are all wrapped up inside that product<br />
and that market. Nowhere else.  And no outside ride—no outside formula<br />
will give them to you. You are facing a product-market-timing relationship<br />
that never happened before—it is unique. And the solution you need is<br />
just as unique.  What this first part of the book has tried to give vou is<br />
not molds, but compasses. Not formulas to copy word by word, or rules to<br />
rigidlv follow. But rather guide-posts to set your thinking in the right<br />
direction. Specifically and technically, these guideposts fall into two<br />
classes: The first are analytical procedures. Their purpose is to break down<br />
a complicated problem into its parts . . . to examine those parts one bv one<br />
. . . to find out which is the most important— and to start your solution<br />
from there.  Once you have done this, you then begin to build up your</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><span class="caps">SUMMARY</span>: T H E <span class="caps">ART</span> OF <span class="caps">CREATIVE</span> <span class="caps">PLANNING</span></p>
<p>solution to its greatest power. You do this bv removing limiting factors,<br />
and bv adding everything you can find that will strengthen your idea. If we<br />
wrote literature instead of advertising, these two processes would be called<br />
conception and execution. In copy writing, we sav that we get the main theme<br />
for our ad, and then we put it into a headline.  And when vou have finished,<br />
vou have five or ten words. If thev are the right words, thev will be immensely<br />
valuable. But they still will be onlv the start. Thev are the end of one road,<br />
and the beginning of another. Thev are the imitation to vour ad—the hand<br />
vou extend to your prospect for vour product. Your job is now to make that<br />
introduction worth while—for both parties.  In the remainder of the book,<br />
we shall discuss the techniques of writing the bodv copy of vour ad. These<br />
techniques are directed toward one end: building conviction—not onlv<br />
instilling the desire for vour product, but actually strengthening that desire<br />
with the belief that that product will DO what the prospect wants.  We now<br />
turn to this process of building vour ad, so that vour ad builds conviction.</p>

<p>You have now built vour headline.  You now have a means of stopping your<br />
prospect—of bringing to a momentary halt all the diverse activities of<br />
his mind—of focussing his attention, at least for a moment, on a single<br />
thought.  This is the job that you have designed vour headline to do—not<br />
to sell, or identify your product, or even mention the need or desire that<br />
your product satisfies—but simply and solelv to flag down your prospect,<br />
and get him to read your first paragraph.  From that moment on, your body<br />
copy does the selling. It does this by altering your prospect&#8217;s vision of<br />
reality. It creates a new world for your prospect—a world in which your<br />
product emerges as the fulfillment of the dominant desire that caused this<br />
man to respond to your headline.  To create this world, your copy must expand<br />
or alter one or more of the three dimensions of his alreadv-existing mental<br />
world. This is the task of the remainder of your ad. Your copv 71</p>
<p>lA</p>
<p><span class="caps">INSIDE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">MIND</span></p>
<p>must be long enough to accomplish this change—and the length of your ad<br />
will depend on three factors: First, how much copy you need to build his<br />
desire for that product—and everything that product can do for him—to its<br />
greatest possible strength.  Second, how much additional copy you need to make<br />
him feel both comfortable and complimented bv that product, to enable him to<br />
visualize that product as a part of the life structure that he has built, and<br />
is building, for himself.  And, finally, how much additional copy vou need to<br />
make him believe what you have said—to compensate for his alreadyexisting<br />
prejudices and beliefs.  The answers to these three questions determine not<br />
onlv the length of your ad, but also its structure, its development, its<br />
style and its pace. Each of these questions relates to a separate dimension<br />
of your prospect&#8217;s mind—different wavs he has of arranging thoughts and<br />
feelings. In this chapter, we will examine these three dimensions briefly,<br />
and sketch in what wavs, and to what extent, you can alter or expand them<br />
through vour ad. And then, in the following chapters, we will detail these<br />
mechanisms of persuasion thoroughly along with the most effective techniques<br />
of presenting them.  And then, in the last chapter, we will trv to weave them<br />
together into a simple, straight-line, logical progression of images —leading<br />
your reader from the headline, through the product, to the actual purchase.<br />
Let us start with these three dimensions of thought and feeling:</p>
<p>1. Desires These are the wants, needs, cravings, thirsts, hungers, lusts,<br />
etc. that drive your prospect through life. They are physical—such as<br />
the desire to be thin, or strong, or healthy, or free from acne, corns,<br />
bad breath or what have vou. Thev are material—such as</p>
<p><span class="caps">INSIDE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> PROSPECT&#8217;S <span class="caps">MIND</span></p>
<p>73</p>
<p>the desire to possess monev, or a big car, or a beautiful dress.  Thev are<br />
sensual—such as the thirst for a cold glass of beer, or the need for a<br />
tired bodv to stretch out on a soft bed.  They have, of course, tremendous<br />
driving power. And thev already exist. You cannot create them, diminish them,<br />
or battle them. But you can expand them, sliarpen them, channel them, and<br />
give them a goal. And this is vour primary task as a copy writer.  Your first<br />
task—and in some ads vour only task—is to make vour prospect want. To<br />
sharpen his desire. To picture every moment of its fulfillment. To let<br />
him see it, feel it, touch it, sit in it, listen to his friends rave about<br />
it. To make him visualize the wonderful new world your product offers him<br />
so strongly that he practically lives in it—and then to offer him that<br />
product. The method of doing this—Intensification—will be discussed<br />
in the next chapter.  2. Identifications These are the roles vour prospect<br />
wants to play in life, and the personality traits he wants vour product to<br />
help him build, or project.  These longings for identification—longings for<br />
a sharplydefined personality—longings for social status—are, of course,<br />
not materia] or physical or sensual at all. Thev complement and intensify the<br />
physical desires—add another dimension to them— bv making each purchase<br />
serve a double duty. Thus, not only does a woman buy a low-calorie food to<br />
become thin, but in so doing she also builds again a radiant, attractive,<br />
youthful personality. And not only does a man buy a car for the power, speed<br />
and transportation it will give him, but equally as much for the projection<br />
of prestige, success and readv-cash-to-burn that this purchase communicates<br />
to his neighbors.  Call them what you will—goals, hopes, dreams, ambitions,<br />
envies, admirations, phantasies or objectives—these subtle, svm-</p>
<p><span class="caps">INSIDE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> P R O S P E C T S <span class="caps">MIND</span></p>
<p>bolic, never-openly-spoken projections of our own self-images are immensely<br />
powerful sales forces. Your task is to put them directly behind your<br />
product. To make him feel the prestigious and select group he joins when he<br />
becomes a user of that product. To picture for him the people who live in<br />
vour product&#8217;s world todav.</p>
<p>3. Beliefs These are the opinions, attitudes, prejudices, fragments of<br />
knowledge and conceptions of reality that vour prospect lives bv.  This is<br />
the world of emotionalized reason that he inhabits—the way he accepts or<br />
rejects facts and builds up his universe, the types of thinking he uses to<br />
arrive at decisions, the ideas and values which give him comfort and which<br />
he believes are permanent and true.  These ideas may be shallow or profound,<br />
valid or false, perfectly logical or mere wishful thinking. But it is not<br />
advertising&#8217;s mission to argue with them. And no one advertiser can change<br />
them. Advertising is not education; it does not have societv as its sponsor,<br />
nor does it have the vears of time that are given to education to produce<br />
results.  Advertising, like science, must accept reality as it exists,<br />
not as it might wish it to exist. Only then can it alter reality—not<br />
bv smashing into it head-on—but bv exploiting its tendencies and giving<br />
direction to its energies.  Believing is a process—a process of fitting new<br />
facts into certain established patterns of thought and conviction. People<br />
believe in certain ways. These beliefs form a filter through which your<br />
product-information must pass or be rejected. And their already-established<br />
patterns of reasoning create habit-channels along which your copy must build<br />
its conviction—or die.  You start with these beliefs as a base. You build<br />
up from them by using his kind of logic, not vour own, to prove that vour<br />
product satisfies his desires—to prove that your product works—to</p>
<p><span class="caps">INSIDE</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">PROSPECT</span> S <span class="caps">MIND</span></p>
<p>prove that his kind of people rely on your product—to prove that<br />
no other product satisfies his needs as well.  The mechanisms<br />
for doing this are shown in Chapters 9 and 10.  There you have<br />
them. Desires. . . . Identifications. . . . Beliefs.  Each of them composed of<br />
equal parts of emotion and thought.  The three dimensions of vour prospect&#8217;s<br />
mind—the raw materials with which you will work.  To study them, we shall<br />
deal with each of them separatelv.  But, in actually writing your ad, of<br />
course, you will weave them into each other—to create a simple, fluid path<br />
of thought from the beginning to the end of vour ad. This technique—Blending<br />
and Reinforcement—will be the subject of Chapter 14.</p>
<p>7 <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FIRST</span> <span class="caps">TECHNIQUE</span> OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>Thirteen Ways to Strengthen Desire The force that creates sales, that powers<br />
our present economy, is desire. Mass Desire, spread among millions of men and<br />
women. And the art of salesmanship, fundamentally and primarily, is expanding<br />
this desire. Expanding it horizontally, among more and more people. Expanding<br />
it vertically by sharpening and magnifying it—by building it to such a<br />
pitch that it overcomes the obstacles of skepticism, lethargy and price,<br />
and results in the sale.  Advertising is salesmanship in print. Therefore,<br />
above everything else, advertising is the literature of desire. It is society&#8217;s<br />
encyclopedia of dreams . . . our twentieth-century Wish Book. Advertising gi<br />
y e s form and content to desire. It provides it with a goal.  These desires,<br />
as they exist in the mind of vour prospect today, are indistinct. They are<br />
blurs—hazy, ambiguous, not yet</p>
<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>crystallized into words or images. In most cases, tliev are simply vague<br />
emotions, without compulsion or direction. And as such, they have only<br />
a fraction of their true potential power.  Your job is to fill out these<br />
vague desires with concrete images—to show your prospect every possible<br />
way that they can be fulfilled—to multiply their strength by the number of<br />
satisfactions that you can suggest to achieve them.  A copy writer&#8217;s first<br />
qualifications are imagination and enthusiasm. You are literally the script<br />
writer for vour prospect&#8217;s dreams. You are the chronicler of his future. Your<br />
job is to show him in minute detail all the tomorrows that vour product<br />
makes possible for him.  This is the core of advertising—its fundamental<br />
function. To take unformulated desire, and translate it into one vivid scene<br />
of fulfillment after another. To add the appeal of concrete satisfaction<br />
after satisfaction to the basic drive of that desire. To make sure that your<br />
prospect realizes everything that he is getting— everything that he is now<br />
leaving behind him—everything that he may possibly be missing.  The sharper<br />
you can draw vour pictures—and the greater the number of them that you<br />
can legitimately present—the more your prospect will demand your product,<br />
and the less important will seem your price.  How much space can you give to<br />
this process of Intensification? This depends on two factors—the amount<br />
of space allotted to you for the entire ad, and the number of wavs vou can<br />
present your images without giving the feeling of repetition or boredom.<br />
First of all, different media demand different treatments. For example,<br />
catalogs, small-space newspaper and magazine advertising, radio and television<br />
strictly limit the number of words given to you to draw your images. To<br />
fit vour message into their structures, you must use either or both of two<br />
techniques. The first is compression—the boiling down of projections and<br />
images into a few key words. And the second is the campaign—the repetition<br />
of these key words over and over again—along with a</p>
<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>79</p>
<p>progression of embellishments and differentiations—through an entire<br />
series of advertisements.  We shall see how this is done, in detail, at the<br />
end of this chapter.  On the other hand, large-space newspaper and magazine<br />
advertising and especially direct mail give you adequate room, in most cases,<br />
to present a full story In these media, the decision as to length depends far<br />
more on the second factor—the number of ways you can present your images<br />
without giving the feeling of repetition or boredom.  No matter what you do,<br />
your prospect will take with him only one basic idea, one dominant image<br />
from vour ad. But with every additional new and different wav that vou can<br />
present that idea, it becomes sharper and more real in vour prospect&#8217;s mind,<br />
and it builds up more and more emotional weight.  Thus the problem becomes one<br />
of perspective, of fresh viewpoints, of new and different detail. Of walking<br />
around vour product in your imagination, and presenting it to your prospect in<br />
ever}* way in which it enters his life.  You are working against two opposing<br />
forces. The first, as in your headline, is the amount of material which has<br />
already been presented to your prospect about similar products in other ads.<br />
There are stages of market sophistication to be dealt with in bodv copy as<br />
well as in your headline. If your prospect has read the same phraseology<br />
before, he will be bored bv it, no matter where he encounters it again.<br />
And the second obstacle is the phraseology of vour own ad.  Once you have<br />
presented your basic fulfillment in a certain wav; then you must vary your<br />
viewpoint in your second description, or not present it again. Otherwise<br />
you will lose vour reader in the middle of vour ad.  You cannot repeat, but<br />
you can reinforce. And every time the same basic promise is given a fresh<br />
setting for vour prospect, it reinforces the descriptions that went before<br />
it, and makes vour prospect that much more determined to participate.</p>

<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>The presenting of a series of fresh, new and different fulfillments for<br />
your prospects dominant desire—our first mechanism of persuasion—is<br />
called Intensification. It takes many forms, with many more certainly to be<br />
inyented. We will list some of them here, giving the complete copy examples<br />
to show how thev have been worked out to deal with specific copy problems.<br />
Our illustrations in this part of the book will be drawn mostly from mail<br />
order. The reason for this is simple. Mail order advertising must accomplish<br />
its sale from a single ad, without relying on the cumulative force of the<br />
campaign, and without help from product display or salespeople. Therefore, mail<br />
order tries to present as much of the complete story as possible at one time.<br />
These same techniques apply equally well to all forms of advertising. But<br />
there the}- are usually quite compressed, and their purpose and structure<br />
was not quite so apparent.  Here are these techniques of Intensification:</p>
<p>Your First Presentation of Your Claims 1. First present the product or the<br />
satisfaction it gives directly—bluntly—by a thorough, completely detailed<br />

<p>For there before vou on that living room wall—projected four feet wide<br />

actually glows with exquisite color. You can see every magnificent detail<br />
. . . the animals huddled around the manger . . . the tenderness in the<br />
Virgins eves . . . the smile on the Infant&#8217;s face.  It&#8217;s almost as though<br />

the Star of Bethlehem rising over the world! Thev stand side by side with<br />
the Three Wise men in silent adoration!  Before their very eyes, thev see<br />
Christ grow to maturity. They watch him astound the elders of the Temple as a<br />
small child. They thrill to his first meeting with John the Baptist. They are<br />
present at the Sermon on the Mount.  They witness each of the miracles—see<br />
with their own eves Jesus calming the storm . . . teaching Peter to walk<br />
on the water . . . raising Lazarus from the dead.  Can there be any more<br />
thrilling experience? Suddenly every sermon thev have ever heard . . . overv<br />

<p>Here is a gigantic, three-dimensional, all plastic model airplane—resting<br />
securely on its own triple landing gear— and so huge that its tail section<br />
alone stands six full rnehes from the table!  This magnificent model airplane<br />
proudly bears the official colors of Pan American Airways! Its wings and<br />
engines are a dazzling silver! Its fuselage is a gleaming white— with a<br />
brilliant blue stripe stretching back twentv-one inches along the entire<br />
length of the bodv! And stamped on both sides of the huge rudder is the Fan<br />
American World Globe— and the American flag above it. ready to identify<br />
this plane anywhere she goes!  Both the wings and the tail section are slanted<br />
diagonally back—ready to cut through the air at 600 scale miles an hour! And<br />
suspended beneath the wings are the four huge engines—each as long and<br />

<p>This model is perfectly designed for high-speed flight!  As soon as it picks<br />
up power from the motion of vour hand, it will lift up its nose, its wings<br />
will begin to cut through the air, it will flash upward and streak ahead<br />
of vou! As vou give it more and more line, it will turn wider and wider.<br />
fly faster and faster . . . You can flv it in circles only five feet wide,<br />
or you can take it outdoors and flv it in gigantic arcs one hundred feet<br />
wide—the size of an entire eitv lot . . .  You can make this plane soar<br />
upward—stall at fantastic heights—dive toward the ground—and then pick<br />
up speed and flash upward again in a breath-taking rescue! . . .  You can<br />
spiral this magnificent model down into a perfect landing! You can fly two<br />
or more planes in formation! You can have jet races! You can have an entire<br />
fleet of breathtaking models flown by every member of vour family—and you<br />
can have them for only $1 apiece—less than <span class="caps">ONEFIFTH</span> the price you&#8217;d pay for<br />
a plastic model of this size and performance! . . .  Or, as another example,<br />
this product-in-action description from a brochure selling a self-propelled<br />
fish lure: . . . Think of it! To fuel up this amazing, live-action lure, all<br />
vou do is this. Simply snap open the fuel chamber—pour in the absolutely<br />
harmless fuel—and close the fuel chamber again! . . . Simply cast or lower<br />
that powerpacked lure into fresh or salt water—and get set for the fishing<br />
thrill of your life!  For perhaps one minute, the lure will float quietly<br />
on the surface of the water. But then that water will reach the fuel charge<br />
inside—the lure will seem to shudder for a second—and then it will spring<br />
dramatically to &#8220;life&#8221;!  The air around it will be filled with the buzzing<br />
sound of a dying bee! Instantly, the nose of the lure will point downward,<br />
and it will begin its first descent! Slowly, jerkily, like a maimed minnow, it<br />
will swim noisily downward—buzzing and humming—traveling about nine feet<br />
every fifteen seconds! If no fish intercepts it, it will then automatically<br />
stop its descent—slowly raise up its nose— and begin its irresistible<br />
climb to the surface again!</p>

this kind of treatment, put your reader right smack in the middle of this<br />
product-in-action story, and give him a verbal demonstration of icJiat will<br />
happen to him the first day he owns that product. For example, this passage<br />
from an ad selling a power booster for the average car: . . . Picture<br />
this to yourself! Next weekend vou go down to vour car—the same tired<br />
car that you&#8217;ve been driving for years. You&#8217;ve made only one simple change<br />
to that car, so easy that vour sixteen year old son could do it. But now,<br />
when you turn on the ignition, a modern miracle of engineering science comes<br />
to life under your hood!  From the very first moment, you&#8217;ll see and feel<br />
the difference in that engine! . . . When vou release the emergency brake,<br />
vour car will glide out of its parking space— roll down the street with<br />
vour foot hardlv touching the gas pedal. Every 30 or 40 seconds, you&#8217;ll<br />
give that car an extra shot of gas—feeling it spurt ahead—testing the<br />
new power that&#8217;s singing underneath vour foot!  We ask vou to pull up to<br />
another car at the stop light, of approximately the same year and make as<br />
your own!  Wait until the light changes from red to green. Let the other car<br />
start first. Wait till the other car gets half way across the street. And<br />
then slam your foot down on the gas pedal!  Before that other car has even<br />
crossed the street, vou will have caught up with him. For one brief second,<br />
vou and that other car will race fender to fender. And then vou</p>

<p>Show Him H o w to Test Your Claims 4. But there is still more room to expand<br />
the image along these lines. Turn the demonstration into a test. Let your<br />
reader visualize himself proving the performance of your product—gaining<br />
its benefits immediately—in the most specific and dramatic way possible. For<br />
example, in this ad, selling a new kind of spark</p>
<p>plug: . . . when you get your set of SA <span class="caps">FIRE</span> L\&quot;JECTORS, here is all you<br />
do. If you have an automatic transmission, make a note of how fast your car<br />
crawls forward when it is in the drive position, with the motor idling. If<br />
vou have a sports car, a racing car or boat, make a note of the RPM&#8217;s as<br />
indicated on the tachometer when the engine is idling.  If you have regular<br />
transmission, put your car in low gear on a level road and notice its speed<br />
with the motor idling.  Next . . . screw your injectors right into the spark<br />
plug openings &#8230;  Now, if you have an automatic transmission—put vour car<br />
in drive and let your engine idle. If vour car stood still with spark plugs,<br />
it will now move forward at from 4 to 6 miles an hour; that means that the<br />
amount of gas that just kept your engine turning over will now carrv vou up<br />
to 6 miles at no cost to you.  If you have a racing or sports car or a boat<br />
with a tachometer, your RPM&#8217;s will increase up to 200 more at idling and up<br />
to 300 more at high speeds.  If you have regular transmission, in low gear<br />
with vour motor idling your car will move forward 4 to 6 miles per hour<br />
faster. In other words, no matter what vou drive, here is absolute proof<br />
that you can go further, faster and cheaper&#8230;</p>

shoots and buds! Some of your plants may actually <span class="caps">DOUBLE</span> in height and<br />

or two short weeks—without your even touching vour plant—this amazing<br />

sends out a second wonder-working nutrient—that enters into even cell<br />
of vour plants&#8217; bodies—that fills those cells with health and strength<br />
and sturdiness . . . Great, tall stems stand up with militarv precision!<br />
Giant buds begin to swell with vigor and vitalitv! Even tired old shrubs<br />
and trees—that you had almost given up for lost—begin to straighten<br />
out—fatten up—send out the voung green growth that you had never hoped<br />
to see again!  And then, the most remarkable part of all! Just as these<br />
fantastically beautiful plants have reached their full, glorious height and<br />
strength—at that moment these tinv English pellets automatically liberate<br />

<p>Bring In an Audience 6. At the end of this passage, other actors besides<br />
the reader are brought into the scene. Each one of them—each group of<br />
them—provides a fresh new perspective through which your reader can view<br />
the product. Seen through their eyes—experienced through their actions<br />
and reactions—the product performances become new, vivid and completely<br />
different again.  These new participants mav be celebrities, who relate<br />
their experiences through the testimonial. This technique is too familiar<br />
to warrant an example here. Or they may be average men and women, whom the<br />
reader easily identifies with, whose experiences are related through narration<br />
or the case history. Probably the most famous example of a narration is the<br />
&#8220;They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano&#8221; ad quoted in the first section<br />
of this book. Here, as an example of the case-history approach, we use a<br />
passage from a reducing ad: . . . And then, if vou were like the men and women<br />
whose fantastic case histories were reported by leading medical journals,<br />
perhaps vou went to vour doctor and asked him for AN <span class="caps">EASY</span> <span class="caps">WAY</span> OUT—WITHOUT<br />

a tinv grev pill—and a common-sense plan . . .  Thev instructed dozens of<br />
patients to test this miracle plan in their own homes, under these doctors&#8217;<br />
supervision. These men and women did <span class="caps">NOT</span> give up the foods they loved—thev<br />
simply and naturally cut down on them!  Thev were not given anv starvation<br />
diets . . . thev reported, in case after case, that thev felt more pep. more<br />
energy, more youth and vitality than thev had known for years!  And then,<br />
dav bv day, faster and easier and safer than they had ever known before,<br />
the uglv excess fat around their bodies melted away! While thev were eating<br />
three delicious meals a dav, thev were shedding as much as five pounds a<br />
week! While thev were feasting on mouth-water-</p>

were losing inch after inch after inch from around their waistlines, their<br />

out of the closets and attics. Men and women both—they beam to notice a new<br />
young look to their chins and faces that thev&#8217;d thought thev&#8217;d lost forever.<br />
And when the plan was over . . . these men and women had lost as much as 17<br />
and 25 and even 34 pounds . . . thev had turned back their weight clock 5. 10<br />
and even 15 years . . . And their trim, slim figures were just beginning. . . .</p>
<p>Show Experts Approving 7. But not only celebrities and ordinary<br />
people can be used to reaffirm the product benefits. Experts in the<br />
fcld—professionals—the sophisticated, the discriminating, the blase can<br />
be called on to register their reactions. There is nothing so astounding as<br />
the astonishment of experts. Here the elements of surprise, competition and<br />
discovery all combine to sharpen the image even more. This example is taken<br />
from the rose ad mentioned above: . . . Just picture the scene as these<br />
college horticulturists began this amazing flowering test of roses. For<br />
here gathered in a test field were all the highh -praised queens of rosedom<br />
. . . floribundas, hybrid teas, polvanthas, patented roses and rose blends<br />
that today sell lor as high as $3.75 for a single plant. Row upon row of<br />

astonishment on these experts&#8217; faces when in the first month alone, Nearly<br />
Wild produced over 15 times more blossoms than the average of all other roses<br />
combined; how in July alone it produces an average of 50 new roses a day,<br />
more than 7 times as many blossoms as the second leading rose! How in August<br />
it produced 21 times more roses than its nearest competitor; and then went<br />

<p>Is it anv wonder that a famous rose expert upon viewing the results of<br />
this test, exclaimed: &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s like having a complete rose garden of 20<br />
plants—all on a single bush!&#8221; Or whv another rose expert, shaking his head in<br />
disbelief, stated: &#8220;If we ever released these flowering figures to the public,<br />
they&#8217;d never believe it. And if they did believe it, we couldn&#8217;t produce<br />
Nearly Wild rose plants to fill the demand in the next 25 vears!&#8221;. . . .</p>
<p>Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority 8. Each new approach suggests others. The<br />
competition can be carried into contrast. The disadvantages of the old<br />
product or service can he laid side by side with the advantages of the<br />
new— throwing these advantages into sharp relief. Here, as one example,<br />
is a brief, three-sentence passage from a book-club radio commercial that<br />
establishes the difference between random buying and book-club savings<br />
indelibly on the listener&#8217;s mind: . . . Yes! While vour friends were paying<br />

exactly the same book—for only 990! • • • Or, as another example,<br />
here is a passage from a direct mail piece selling a Fuel Reclaimer—a<br />
device for the engine of your car that feeds escaping crankcase gases back<br />
into your carburetor: . . . This device uses the suction-power of your own<br />
motor to scoop up that smoke. And then—in one of the most brilliant ideas<br />
in engineering history—it destroys that smoke</p>

<p>by feeding it back into your engine, where it is burned up again as a<br />
continuous, extra flow of fuel!  Think of it! Instead of polluted oil,<br />
polluted engine, polluted air—vou get a constant stream of extra gasoline<br />
flowing into your engine, almost as though vou had a free, second gas tank<br />
connected to vour car!  Instead of one breakdown after another, one more repair<br />
bill after another, each more expensive than before you get young-car power,<br />
young-car economy, voung-car resistance to repair bills, because the deadlv<br />
sludge-causers, acid-causers, filth-causers that used to ruin vour car,<br />
are now being burned up as fuel in vour engine!. . , .</p>
<p>Picture the Black Side, Too 9. And there&#8217;s no need to neglect the<br />
Heaven-Or-Hell approach. Here the negative aspect to every promise—the<br />
problem that you are liberating your prospect from forever—is painted in all<br />
its full black color. You irritate the wound, and then you apply the salve<br />
that heals it.  Thus you derive two currents of motivation—repulsion away<br />
from the former problem or inadequate product, and the attraction generated<br />
by your own product&#8217;s contrasting solutions.  There are several forms in<br />
which vou can present this beforeand-after picture. You can do it through<br />
narration or the testimonial. You can do it by using the &#8220;pitch&#8221; technique<br />
of product ridicule. Or you can simply present straight description of the<br />
old product or problem, with all its detailed drawbacks, and then follow<br />
it directly with a similar description of vour new solution in a perfectly<br />
parallel style, item by item. Here, as an example, is a passage from an ad<br />
selling a new kind of spark plug: . . . Someday, if you ever have a spare<br />
moment, lift one of the old-fashioned spark plugs out of vour car! Look at<br />
the bottom of that plug. In 10 seconds, vou&#8217;II learn more about gas waste<br />
than any book could teach vou in a vear!  If that plug has been in your car<br />
three thousand miles or more, then what you&#8217;ll see on the bottom of that plug</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIRST</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>is <span class="caps">FILTH</span>! The Firing Point of that plug—the most important single point<br />
in vour car—will be choked, strangled and fouled with <span class="caps">BLACK</span>, <span class="caps">FILTHY</span><br />
<span class="caps">CARBON</span>! Carbon that robs vour car of as much as 20 vital horsepower everytime<br />
vour engine fires!  Now, wipe that filth awav and look at the Firing Point<br />
itself. This is the <span class="caps">POWER</span> <span class="caps">POINT</span> of your car . . . the pinhead of electricitv<br />
that turns raw gas into 300 horsepower of driving energy! And what is the<br />
condition of that point?  CORRODED—PITTED—SCARRED—-<span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">WORN</span>!  Hardlv able<br />
to deliver half the spark that it should! Wasting gas—wasting monev evervtime<br />
vou put vour foot down on the gas pedal!  Yes! You pay $2,000—83.000—84.000<br />
for your car. And&#8217; a single 99c part robs vou of the real power and enjovment<br />
of that car.  AT <span class="caps">LAST</span>! A <span class="caps">PLUG</span> SO <span class="caps">SMART</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> IT THINKS&quot;!  Now look at the new<br />

variations are limitless. At everv point that your product touches the life<br />
of vour prospect price, availability, ease of use, durability, portability<br />
replacement and maintenance, even unwrapping the carton it comes in—it<br />
furnishes you with another fresh perspective in which to reiterate and<br />
reemphasize its benefits. Here is just one example—stressing the ease<br />
of application, and contrasting it with the tremendous benefits that that<br />
application gives you: . . . One week from today, vou are going down to your<br />

all the skill vou need! And yet in that 30 seconds work, vou will improve<br />
that cars performance in eight different wavs!  With just 30 seconds work,<br />
you will strengthen the engine of that car so greatly that you will get 2<br />
to 3 to 5 miles more per gallon from every gallon vou buv. . .  With just<br />
30 seconds work, you will lubricate that engine so thoroughly that you will<br />
drive up to 5.000 full miles without even looking at vour oil. . .  And,<br />
with just 30 seconds work, you will protect that engine so completely that<br />
you will add up to four years to its power and life! . . . You will push<br />
off the ring and piston jobs that might cost you $75 each—for vears!.</p>
<p>Use Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination 11. Nor do you have to be satisfied merely<br />
with the statement of rate fact. There are infinite opportunities for the<br />
use of imagination to present those facts in more dramatic form, outside of<br />
the rigidly realistic approach. Some of the more famous examples are the<br />
Alexander Hamilton ad of the Twenties, &#8220;The Glory of the Upward Path.&#8221; Or<br />
the Big Ben alarm clock series, &#8220;First he whispers, then he shouts.&#8221; Or this<br />
passage from perhaps the most</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIRST</span> <span class="caps">TECHNIQUE</span> OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: INTENSIFICATION&#8217;</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>long-lived ad of them all, the Shenvin Cody English Course, in which a manual<br />
of instruction is personified and given actual life: The basic principle of<br />
Mr. Cody&#8217;s new method is habit-forming. Anyone can learn to write and speak<br />
correctly bv constantly using the correct forms. But how is one to know<br />
in each case which is correct? Mr. Cod}&#8217; solves this problem in a simple,<br />
unique, sensible way.  100% Self-Correcting Device.  Suppose he himself were<br />
standing forever at your elbow. Every time you mispronounced or misspelled<br />
a word, every time you violated correct grammatical usage, every time vou<br />
used the wrong word to express what you meant, suppose vou could hear him<br />
whisper. &#8220;That is wrong, it should be thus and so.&#8221; In a short time you would<br />
habitually use the correct form and the right words in speaking and writing.<br />
If vou continued to make the same mistakes over and over again, each time<br />
patiently he would tell you what was right. He would, as it were, be an<br />
everlasting mentor beside vou—a mentor who would not laugh at you, but<br />
who would, on the contrary, support and help you. This 100% Self-Correcting<br />
Device does exactly this thing. It is Mr.  Cody&#8217;s silent voice behind you,<br />
reach&#8217; to speak out whenever vou commit an error. It finds your mistakes<br />
and concentrates on them. You do not need to study anything you alreadv<br />
know. There are no rules to memorize. . . .  Before You&#8217;re D o n e , Summarize<br />
12. To repeat again, there is an infinite number oi new approaches. No list<br />
of them can ever be complete, because new applications, new perspectives,<br />
new viewpoints are being discovered every day.  Which of them, and how many<br />
of them you will use in a single ad, is a matter of timing and balance as you<br />
begin to put your ad together. As long as each additional fresh perspective<br />
continues to huild the dominant desire in your prospect&#8217;s mind, use it.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>But if the additional perspective is not different or dramatic enough to<br />
renew your prospect&#8217;s interest in your claims, then leave it out.  To a large<br />
degree, this is a matter of sensitivity and originality on your part. The<br />
sensitivity comes from intuition and experience; the originality often comes<br />
from nothing more than hard work. And perhaps the best way to measure the<br />
balance between the two— that critical turning point where reinforcement<br />
becomes mere repetition—is to re-read your ad, some davs after vou have<br />
first written it.  There are, however, two conventional summary devices<br />
which are almost always used, and which must be mentioned here.  The first<br />
of these is the &#8220;catalog.&#8221; This is a brief condensed listing of all the<br />
product&#8217;s performances, benefits, and/or applications, one after the other,<br />
without description, dramatization or elaboration. Each of the benefits<br />
or perspectives which might have been given three or four paragraphs at the<br />
beginning of your ad, is here summed up in a single line.  There are two types<br />
of catalogs. Those that expand desire horizontally, among ever-enlargening<br />
groups of applications or prospects. And those that expand desire vertically<br />
bv deepening or magnifying that desire.  Here is an example of the first type<br />
of catalog—used to list all the applications of a blow torch kit that might<br />
conceivably sell it to a home owner: <span class="caps">ALL</span> IN <span class="caps">ONE</span>!  Blow-Torch, Paint-Remover,<br />
Soldering Iron!  Professional-hpe Propane Torch also doubles as fast, safe<br />
Paint Remover and precision Soldering Iron! Does 101 jobs around the house,<br />
including— Laving tile; removing paint or putt}&#8217;; thawing frozen pipes;<br />
sweating copper tubing; soldering gutters; repairing electrical work; starting<br />
charcoal fires and fireplaces: burning weeds, parasites and damp leaves;<br />
thawing frozen locks; light brazing; loosening rusty bolts; car body and fender</p>
<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>97</p>
<p>repairs; soldering aluminum, silver and jewelry and other hobbies, and manv,<br />
manv more. . . .  It is quite obvious, of course, that this catalog device<br />
uses the &#8220;shotgun approach.&#8221; Up to this point, vour ad has taken a single<br />
dominant desire, and developed that single desire to the point of absolute<br />
maximum intensity. This willingness to gamble on being precisely right—on<br />
having chosen the one most powerful appeal—gives your ad the impact of a<br />
high-velocity rifle.  But it also demands the accuracy of an expert marksman.<br />
Now—through this multi-appeal catalog listing—vou have a last-minute<br />
chance to hedge. Now vou &#8220;shotgun&#8221; with every wideangled appeal, benefit<br />
and application in the book. Before vou were heightening a single desire,<br />
bv picturing the satisfaction of that desire in a dozen different settings.<br />
Now you are building an effect of a different kind—one of sheer magnitude,<br />
of number, of infinite possibilities—in the hope that any one of them,<br />
or the combination of all of them working together, mav provide the extra<br />
added push that closes the sale.  This catalog technique was born in mail<br />
order book selling, and here it has its widest application. This next example<br />
is a continuation of the memory book ad we quoted above: . . . But this is<br />
just the beginning of the &#8220;miracles&#8221; vou can perform with vour memory. This<br />
secret is just one of the over 50 <span class="caps">MEMORY</span> <span class="caps">INTENSIFIERS</span> contained in this book&#8230;<br />
For instance—REMEMBERING <span class="caps">NAMES</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">FACES</span>! . . . How would vou like to walk<br />
into a room of twenty new people—meet each one of them onlv once— and<br />
then remember their names, automatically, for as long as vou live . . .<br />
Think of the advantage in business, when vou can call every customer bv<br />
his first name, and then ask for his wife and children, instantly, by their<br />
first names! Think of the impression you&#8217;ll make when you ask him about the<br />
state of his business, his hobbies, when vou repeat, almost word for word,<br />
the last conversation vou had with him. Think of</p>

<p>becoming the celebrity at your club—as the member who &#8220;knows everyone&#8221;—who<br />
can be depended on to avoid mistakes, to win new friends for the organization,<br />
to get things done!  But this is still just the beginning! This book teaches<br />
you to remember exactly what you hear and read! . . . It teaches you how to<br />
memorize a speech or a sales presentation. in minutes! It teaches vou how to<br />
remember every card played when you relax at night! . . . It shows vou how<br />
to improve the depth and force and power of vour mind!  How to double your<br />
vocabulary—learn dozens of wavs to burn new words into your memory—learn<br />
their meanings without looking them up—repeat entire phrases, sentences,<br />
paragraphs from the great writers! You&#8217;ll be able to learn a foreign language<br />
in a few short weeks—at least three to four times as quickly and easily<br />
as vou could without this system! You&#8217;ll be able to hear a joke, storv or<br />
anecdote onlv once, and then repeat it in the same hilarious wav!  Yes! And<br />
most important of all, this book will show you how to professionally organize<br />
vour mind—do what vou have to do in half the time! You&#8217;ll remember dates,<br />
addresses, appointments—automatically! You&#8217;ll carry dozens of telephone<br />
numbers in the file-cabinet of \our mind! . . .  Let me send you this book,<br />
and prove these facts to vou in one short evening, or it doesn&#8217;t cost vou<br />
a penny! . . .</p>
<p>The second use for this catalog technique is to pile desire upon desire,<br />
rather than application upon application. It is again a building of<br />
magnitude, of number—but this time in summary of all the perspectives<br />
that have gone before. This example is taken from the Fish Lure ad quoted<br />
above: . . . Here&#8217;s What This Amazing, Self-Propelled Fish Lure Does For You!<br />
First of all, this Self-Propelled Fish Lure frees vou forever from the filthy<br />
task of digging for worms and crawlers, catching frogs, or paying 500 to<br />

<p>101</p>
<p>At the end of vour ad as well as at its beginning—Intensification—building<br />
desire by presenting continually new images of its satisfaction through<br />
your product. The first of the Processes of Persuasion.  How to Apply These<br />
Principles of Intensification to the Campaign As mentioned at the beginning<br />
of this chapter, we have used predominantly mail order examples to illustrate<br />
the mechanism of Intensification. We have done this for two reasons. First,<br />
because mail order customarilv uses long copv and hyperbole; and it is through<br />
the extremes ol this long copv and these superlatives that we can see these<br />
techniques working most clearly.  Secondly, we have used mail order for<br />
these examples because mail order says all it has to sav about a product in a<br />
single ad. There are no mail order &#8220;campaigns,&#8221; in the sense of a series of<br />
different-though-related advertisements, appearing one after the other, and<br />
based on a common theme. Mail order compresses such a campaign into a single<br />
ad. It savs all it can, everything it can think of, in this one ad (which is<br />
often laboriously fitted together out of a series of preliminary ads, each of<br />
which contributes some element to the finished form). And then, when it has<br />
proven itself successful, it is frozen—even to the point of typography—and<br />
run until it has exhausted its potential.  Thus, mail order as a rule contains<br />
the greatest number of these Intensification devices in a single ad; and bv<br />
studying these mail order ads we can see them working against each other,<br />
complementing each other, reinforcing each other, strengthening the overall<br />
effect as paragraph is piled on paragraph.  But in national advertising, the<br />
rules change. While mail order is a series of introductions of new products,<br />
the average life of which is less than two years, national advertising is<br />
concerned with products whose life span is far greater, often approaching<br />
the entire life span of advertising itself. And while the</p>
<p>WZ</p>
<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>mail order advertisement runs once, and then is not repeated for three to<br />
six months, national advertising must keep its product image constantly<br />
in front of its public, and therefore must run far more frequently.  Thus,<br />
national advertising, by its frequent insertions, soon loses its immediate<br />
novelty. The creative problem in national advertising thus changes from finding<br />
the theme for a particular advertisement to finding the theme for a series of<br />
advertisements.  And the problem of Intensification shifts from building desire<br />
throughout the advertisement to building desire throughout the series. And<br />
an entirely new problem of balance emerges—that of keeping continuity<br />
throughout the series, hy maintaining the dominant image sharp enough and<br />
identifiable enough to utilize the desire generated hy past advertisements,<br />
and at the same time varying that image sufficiently to induce the prospect<br />
to read it again, and therefore reinforce and sharpen that desire.  Assuming<br />
that you have found your dominant image, vour creative problem now becomes<br />
two-fold. First, to compress that image into a single statement or picture,<br />
so powerful that it will sell the product the very first time it is used,<br />
and so true to the heart of your market that it will continue to sell that<br />
product, even when it is used over and over again.  It is important to realize<br />
that—as the campaign develops— this dominant image or idea cannot remain<br />
as the headline. To present the same basic headline (or lead picture) time<br />
after time to the same audience would soon make the campaign unreadable This<br />
leads us to your second creative problem. To present a series of variations or<br />
perspectives of that central image—each emerging from your dominant idea,<br />
but each so different from the rest that they impel your prospect to read<br />
through them, and so fresh that they make that dominant idea seem new again.<br />
Thus you have your Central Campaign Idea, and its continuous restatement<br />
in a series of fresh disguises There are as many different ways to use this<br />
basic technique of campaign construction as there are advertising styles. They</p>

the top, in a brief resume of examples, consider the superbly-effective<br />
Colgate campaign of the late 1950s. Here the centra] idea was openly stated,<br />
and precisely repeated, during every advertisement: &#8220;Gardol—the Invisible<br />
Shield that Protects Your Teeth.&#8221;  The variations consisted of a scries of<br />
opening analogies.  Using television as the most sharplv-deflned example,<br />
an invisible shield was shown protecting the announcer against baseballs,<br />
footballs, etc.—against which thev would simply bounce off. The wording of<br />
the commercials was ritualistic. Once the initial demonstration was over, there<br />
was no variation in the sentences that followed: &#8220;Just as this invisible shield<br />
(the announcer raps the shield with his knuckles) protects me against this<br />
baseball, so the invisible shield in Colgate toothpaste protects your teeth<br />
against decay.&#8221;  Here the variations are confined to the opening demonstration<br />
in the first ten seconds of the commercial. These are designed to startle the<br />
viewer (the ball being thrown directly at him from within the television set)<br />
and this emotional reaction is carried over to reinforce the rigidlv repeated<br />
remainder of the commercial. Thus vou have a quick and startling emotional<br />
involvement, welded onto a precise selling message.  Equallv as powerful<br />
is the technique of repeating the exact verbal image throughout a series of<br />
advertisements, while varying and freshening the emotional appeal through a<br />
spectrum ol constantly changing main illustrations. Thus the dominant image<br />
is retained intact—continuity is maintained—but there is no feeling<br />
of over-familiarity or boredom. This technique might be named &#8220;Rule and<br />
Example.&#8221; Two of its most effective uses recently have been in the hair<br />
styling field. First with Toni, where the preciselyrepeated verbal image was:</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIRST</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">WHICH</span> <span class="caps">TWIN</span> <span class="caps">HAS</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> TONI—and which has the $15 permanent?&#8221;  Above this<br />
unvarying headline was a continuouslv-changing stream of pretty girls—each<br />
new picture making the question new again, and requiring an interplay<br />
of examination between the picture and the copy to discover the answer.<br />
The same technique was used, some vears later, bv Clairol to sell their<br />
hair tint. Here the Rule was expressed in the preeiselvrepeated headline:<br />
&#8220;<span class="caps">DOES</span> <span class="caps">SHE</span> OR DOESN&#8217;T <span class="caps">SHE</span> 0 &#8220;Hair-coloring so natural only her hairdresser<br />
knows for sure.&#8221;  Here again, this headline was re-invigorated bv a series<br />
of main illustrations, of attractive young women, in common but glamorized<br />
every-day activities, enjoying their lives. Here again.  the Examples not only<br />
proved the Rule, but renewed it.  At the other extreme, however, the dominant<br />
image mav not even appear in the advertisements themselves, but mav merelv<br />
be the underlying theme for the campaign as a whole. Here the continuity<br />
is retained—not by a precisely-repeated slogan or statement—but by a<br />
single, rigidly-maintained focal point. This focal point may be a dominant<br />
product appeal—such as the Cadillac quality7, which is symbolized in every<br />
Cadillac advertisement in the identification background photography, in the<br />
typography, in the copy style, in the fashions and jewelry that are chosen<br />
to appear with the car, and the credit lines that are given to them— even<br />
to the highly-stylized pen-and-ink drawings that are used when the campaign<br />
shifts to newspapers.  Or, if it so merits, the focal point may be simply<br />
the product itself. In such a campaign, each succeeding advertisement reveals<br />
another fact about the product. Each is completely different; no single phrase<br />
or slogan is repeated twice. Here trie variations comprise the entire verbal<br />
content of the advertisements. But</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIRST</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">INTENSIFICATION</span></p>
<p>105</p>
<p>their subject-matter, and the illustrations, are alwavs the same— the<br />
product.  Perhaps the best example of this technique is the magnificent<br />
Volkswagen magazine campaign. Here the advertisements are reduced to severe<br />
simplicity. There is no background identification whatsoever. Different<br />
perspectives of the product are shown as close-up as possible (except in<br />
the &#8220;Think Small&#8221; advertisement) against an absolutely bare background.<br />
Against this rigid focus on the car itself, to the exclusion of every other<br />
visual element, the series of copv messages presents a complete exploration<br />
of even facet of the car&#8217;s performance, utility, economy, durability service<br />
facilities and what-have-vou.  Any single advertisement is sufficient to<br />
interest a prospective buyer. Together, especially when concentrated in<br />
the same media and reaching the same audience week after week, the series<br />
builds an overwhelming impression of novelty and value—the theme of an<br />
Honest Car. Here, as examples, are only a few of the dozens of different<br />
headlines: &#8220;<span class="caps">THINK</span> <span class="caps">SMALL</span>.&#8221;  (The first in the series, discussing the merits of<br />
compactness as an asset.)  &#8220;Lemon.&#8221;  (Showing what appears to be a perfectly<br />
good car, and discussing the microscopic, almost unnoticeable flaw in it that<br />
disqualified it.)  &#8220;Our new model.&#8221;  (A car that shows no difference, but has<br />
dozens of essential engineering changes inside the car, where thev won&#8217;t make<br />
present models obsolete.)  &#8220;Why you should open the icindoio before you close<br />
the door of a Volkswagen.&#8221;  (Discussing the fact that the car is airtight,<br />
and the quality that this fact symbolizes.)  &#8220;Our number one salesman.&#8221;<br />
(The serviceman, of course, hpifying the quality of care</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>F I R S T T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I N T E N S I F I C A T<br />
I O N</p>
<p>the VW owner gets, and combatting the conception that foreign cars give<br />
sparse service.)  And so on. A series of building-block advertisements,<br />
making no attempt to tell the complete storv in themselves, relying on their<br />
ability to grasp the prospective buver and carrv him through a procession of<br />
short, sharply focussed sales stories that combine to give an informed desire<br />
of tremendous depth.  Notice, incidentally, that each of these headlines<br />
fulfills the requirements necessary to place it at the top of an ad. Each of<br />
them reaches out and touches the prospect at the point of his dominant desire<br />
(to get more value for his car monev). Each expresses the common theme of<br />
the campaign (this is an honest car). And each moves the prospect into the<br />
body copy—it gets him to read the complete, though brief, selling message<br />
(The first second, third and fifth headline do this through presenting<br />
the reader with an apparent contradiction—in the first case, with his<br />
accepted notion of &#8220;thinking big,&#8221; and in the remaining advertisements,<br />
between the message of the headline and the content of the photograph above<br />
it—thus compelling the reader to go through the body copy to resolve<br />
the contradiction. The fourth does it In- promising the reader information<br />
explaining an unusual and provocative request).  Notice also that to accomplish<br />
this noveltv-within-eontinuitv, and to grasp the attention of the prospect<br />
oxer a series of advertisements, and to move him into the bodv copy where<br />
he can be sold more thoroughly, each of these headlines takes the &#8220;Creative<br />
Gamble.&#8221; The product, its trademark, or its performance is not mentioned in<br />
the headline. The copy writer is taking the position that he can only sell<br />
adequately with the number of words allowed him by the body copy. Therefore<br />
he is willing to risk his headline in grasping the attention of his prospect<br />
and impelling him to read on, into the sales message itself, presented<br />
in convincing detail below. If he fails in his gamble, he has wasted his<br />
page. If he succeeds, he has doubled and tripled the effectiveness of his ad.</p>
<p>8 <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SECOND</span> <span class="caps">TECHNIQUE</span> OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>How to Build a Saleable Personality Into Your Product The desires, wants,<br />
needs and cravings of mankind that we have just discussed are, above all,<br />
obvious. The hungry man feels the contractions in his stomach: the sick<br />
man feels his pain. The woman who is overweight feels her embarrassment,<br />
her discomfort, her shame. The desire for satisfaction, or for relief,<br />
displays itself openly. It announces both its wants and its needs. It<br />
responds whole-heartedly and immediately to mechanisms that achieve its aims.<br />
Therefore, the recognition and magnification of this desire is the first and<br />
most obvious task of copy writing. All the principles and techniques described<br />
in the last chapter were practiced to perfection by the patent-medicine<br />
copy writers of the 1890&#8217;s. Before the First World War, Claude Hopkins had<br />
lifted them out of patent-medicine and established them in every category<br />
of general advertising. Until 1954, they literally dominated advertising.  107</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>But there is another kind of desire that exists in the human mind—far<br />
more subtle, partly unconscious, longing not for satisfaction, but for<br />
expression. This second kind of desire is so different from the first,<br />
and operates under such different rules, that it can justly be described<br />
as a second dimension of the human mind. It ma}- be titled the Longing for<br />
Identification. Its rise to prominence as a buying motive marks the great<br />
revolution in merchandising of our time. Its utilization in copy writing—as<br />
an adjunct to desire-building—constitutes our second Mechanism of Persuasion<br />
. . . that of building the proper Identification into vour product.</p>
<p>A Personal Note Let me just inject a personal note here on the names I<br />
have given these Techniques—or processes—I believe you should use<br />
to cumulatively strengthen your copy. As I mention in the Introduction,<br />
I have never heard, or read, a discussion of mam- of these techniques<br />
before. Therefore, they are not part of the common advertising terminology,<br />
and in case after case actually have no names.  ^ Because of this fact, I&#8217;ve<br />
had to invent names for them. Some of these names convey their meaning at<br />
first glance, such as Intensification. Other names I&#8217;ve put together out of<br />
two or more ordinary words, such as Gradaalization, to try to convey an idea<br />
that has purposely been left ambiguous when you first encounter it. And in<br />
still other cases, such as the Identification technique discussed in this<br />
chapter, I&#8217;ve used terms you&#8217; already know and stretched their meaning.<br />
Identification here, for example, means more than the customer&#8217;s process<br />
of identifying with a product personalitv, or even with a group of prestige<br />
users of that product. Here, in this new context I have given it, it means<br />
at the same time the active process by which the copy writer capitalizes on<br />
this need for</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>identification by building its realization through his copv into his product.<br />
The stress is always, in all these techniques, on the word active. These<br />
are the activities vou must accomplish . . . the processes vou must utilize<br />
. . . the psychological effects vou must achieve to give your copy the maximum<br />
possible strength. It is this active, deliberate, ongoing process—this<br />
building of effects— that I have tried to convey bv these terms.  The Roles<br />
Your Prospect Desires What, exactly, is this process of Identification? Quite<br />
simply, it is, first of all, the desire of your prospect to act out certain<br />
roles in his life.  It is the desire of your prospect to define himself to the<br />
world around him—to express the qualities within himself that he values,<br />
and the positions he has attained.  And how do you utilize this longing<br />
for identification when you write your copy? In two ways: First, bv turning<br />
your product into an instrument for achieving these roles. And second, by<br />
turning that product into an acknowledgement that these roles have already<br />
been achieved.  Every product you work on should offer vour prospect two<br />
separate and distinct reasons for buying it. First, it should offer him the<br />
fulfillment of a physical want or need. This is the satisfaction your product<br />
gives him. And second, it should offer him a particular method of fulfilling<br />
that need, that defines him to the outside world as a particular kind of<br />
human being.  This is the role your product offers to vour prospect. It<br />
is the non-functional, super-functional value of that product. And it is<br />
built into that product—not bv engineering—but by merchandising alone.<br />
For example, only the poor man today buvs food for its physical satisfactions<br />
alone. The average American today selects</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>his food. Selects foods that he believes are modern, because he wishes to be<br />
up-to-date. Selects foods that are non-fattening, because he wishes to be<br />
youthful and slim. Selects foods that come from every country and reflect<br />
every taste on earth, because he wishes to be cosmopolitan, adventurous<br />
and sophisticated.  This man no longer buys food for food alone. He has<br />
gained.  or he has been given, a whole new vocabulary of wants. He now<br />
buys, not only objects, but roles. His life becomes devoted to a quest for<br />
acknowledgements—&quot;up-to-date&quot; . . . &#8220;youthful&#8221; &#8220;slim&#8221; . . . &#8220;cosmopolitan&#8221;<br />
. . . &#8220;adventurous&#8221; . . . and &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; in this one instance alone.<br />
And because of this multiplication of wants, this man gives you hundreds of<br />
new ways to focus his attention, to stimulate his desire, to build up that<br />
desire to the point of purchase. Evennew role that he covets—every new<br />
longing-for-identification that he develops—gives you one more mass desire<br />
that you can harness to your product.  What are these roles? Where do they<br />
come from? How do they operate? How do you put them to work for your product?<br />
First of all—the roles themselves. There are two kinds. There are roles<br />
that define character. And there are roles that express achievement. Let&#8217;s<br />
glance brieflv at each: 1. Character Roles Usually expressed by adjectives,<br />
or adjectives-turned-nouns.  For instance—&quot;progressive&quot; . . . &#8220;chic&#8221;<br />
. . . &#8220;charming&#8221; . . . &#8220;brilliant&#8221; . . . &#8220;well-read.&#8221; They are a part of the<br />
personality of vour prospect. They belong to him. His task is to pick out<br />
the ones he values most, and to develop them. And then to turn the spotlight<br />
of other people&#8217;s attention onto them, one after the other.  Attainment of<br />
these character roles—masterv of them—is not enough. Once they have<br />
been mastered, thev must then be acknowledged, valued and admired, or thev<br />
are worthless.  Here again, your product can serve your prospect in three</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F<br />
I C A T I O N</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>distinct ways—beyond its physical satisfactions—in this constant search<br />
for self-definition. First, it can help him achieve mastery of his chosen<br />
character roles—such as a book on philosophy, if he wishes to be thought<br />
of as well-read.  Second, it can help simplify condense or speed up this<br />
mastery—such as a Speed-Reading Course.  And third, and most important,<br />
it can serve as a symbol of that mastery to invoke the acknowledgement or<br />
admiration of his friends—such as a shelf to house both books.  You must<br />
realize that every one of these values goes far bevond the physical<br />
satisfactions of the products themselves. They are supra-functional, and<br />
therefore add an extra incentive for purchase.  The book on philosophy might<br />
not have been purchased if the prospect wished onlv to satisfy his academic<br />
curiosity, and did not also wish to enlighten his friends in conversation. The<br />
Speed-Reading Course might not have been purchased if the prospect wished<br />
only to absorb more information in a shorter period of time, and did not also<br />
wish to use that information to get ahead in both his business and social<br />
life. And certainly the bookshelves would not have been of the same fine<br />
quality-, finish and luxury if the prospect had onlv wished to use them as a<br />
storehouse, and not also as a showpiece.  At least half of all purchases made<br />
today cannot he understood in terms of function alone. It would be absurd for a<br />
man to spend $5,000 for a 150-mile-an-hour sports car for functional reasons,<br />
when he onlv uses it to drive to and from work on congested, 35-mile-an-hour<br />
parkways. His willingness to spend this money onlv becomes rational when vou<br />
take one further fact into consideration—that this 150-mile-an-hour top<br />
speed, this handgear-shift, this fantastic cornering ability all give him as<br />
their owner the role of &quot;sportsman&quot;—and very probably &#8220;successful sportsman&#8221;<br />
at that.  Every product can benefit from this role-giving power. But there<br />
are many products where this ability of character-reinforce-</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E OE <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>ment—whether built into that product by design, bv society or by<br />
advertising—far outweighs in sales value the built-in performance of<br />
that product. In such products, it is the role-giving function that sells,<br />
and not the performance.  One further fact distinguishing these character<br />
roles. Since they are not created by society but by the prospect himself, and<br />
since they are almost never claimed openly but only hinted at.  implied and<br />
prompted, therefore they can never truly be tested or measured, and they<br />
are ambiguous. They are subject to error.  And, more important, they are<br />
subject to fantasy.  Great areas of these character roles literally exist in<br />
the subconscious. They are never given definite words. They are not stated<br />
or discussed, but subtly expressed in symbols and images.  Only rarely<br />
does the prospect even define them to himself. And even more rarely does<br />
he test them against the outside world, to see if they are actually true.<br />
Therefore, your prospect is far more reach to believe in the character roles<br />
you assign to him, than he is to believe in either your product&#8217;s performance<br />
claims, or the achievement roles it may offer him. If the character role is<br />
flattering, such as &#8220;virility,&#8221; and if it is subtly expressed in a non-verbal<br />
image-svmbol, such as a test pilot smoking a cigarette, than the prospect can<br />
easily persuade himself that the same action, smoking, performed on the same<br />
product, the cigarette, conveys to him at least some of the implied virility<br />
of the genuine possessor—in this case, the pilot.  There is no direct claim<br />
made in the advertisement. No verbalization to be passed on by the conscious,<br />
rational mind. No test situation called for where the prospect must prove that<br />
the role is valid. Acceptance is easy painless, non-demanding.  This is not<br />
true of a performance claim, which must be justified in terms of concrete<br />
results to our friends. Nor is it true of an achievement role, which must<br />
stand up to the harsh reality of our position in everyday life. This superb<br />
ease-of-acceptance, this consolation-without-cost feature of the character<br />
role is its</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>great ^trgrigth, and the reason why it should be used to supplement the<br />
verbal claims in every ad.  2. Achievement Roles These are the status<br />
roles . . . class roles . . . position roles that are created by every<br />
society on earth, and offered to the men and women who can earn them. In a<br />
civilization as complex as ours, there are literally hundreds of them—usually<br />
expressed bv nouns, with the nouns serving as titles.  For example, for<br />
men, there are—&quot;Executive&quot; . . . &#8220;Home Owner&#8221; . . . &#8220;$20,000-a-year-Man&#8221;<br />
. . . &#8220;Five Handicap&#8221; . . . &#8220;ManOn-His-Way-Up&#8221; . . . &#8220;Block Chairman&#8221;<br />
. . . and dozens more, embracing every activity of our lives.  For women, the<br />
primary achievement role to be won is &#8220;Wife,&#8221; and from then on—&quot;Fashion<br />
Setter&quot; . . . &#8220;Career Woman&#8221; . . . &#8220;Good Mother&#8221; . . . &#8220;Civic Leader&#8221;<br />
. . . &#8220;Power-Behind-the-Throne&#8221; . . .  &#8220;Patron of the Arts&#8221; . . . and on,<br />
and on.  The list, for both men and women, is endless. Each of these roles<br />
is an achievement to be won, and held, and—most of all— displayed.<br />
Here display is vital—because none of these achievements is obvious. Quite<br />
the opposite, they are immaterial and invisible—mere titles, roles, bundles<br />
of privilege. They do exist—thev are real—and once they are gained, thev<br />
have great potential to alter our lives. But that potential must first be<br />
translated into physical symbols of success, for everyone around us to see.<br />
And the easiest and most universally acknowledged symbols of success in<br />
America today are the products we can buy. Products that are purchased—not<br />
by any stretch of the imagination for their physical function alone—but<br />
for the definition they give us as their possessors. In America today we<br />
are known—not only by the company we keep—but by the products we own.<br />
The most obvious example is the newly-wed woman. Her first act in her new<br />
role as &#8220;Wife&#8221; is to receive a physical gift,</p>
<p>1 1 4</p>
<p>S E C O N D T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>which has absolutely no function other than to define her—the wedding<br />
ring in which she is married. Weeks before this, she has literally been<br />
shedding closets-full of clothes—clothes that still fitted her physically,<br />
but not socially—in order to replace them with a new material personality,<br />
her trousseau.  Her sheets and linens are new. Her furniture and carpeting<br />
are new. Even the very roof over her head, todav, in our societv.  must be<br />
new. Because she is literally a new woman—her new role has transformed<br />
her—and she must express that transformation in everything she owns.<br />
The same principle applies to every aspect of all of our lives.  Every social<br />
role that we achieve in life is immediately translated into those possessions<br />
which we believe express that position most clearly. And as we acquire<br />
these possessions throughout our life.  what we are doing is constructing<br />
for ourselves a &#8220;material personality,&#8221; that we carry with us wherever we<br />
go, and whose function it is to define us, instantly, to whomever we meet.<br />
The &#8220;Man-On-His-Way-Up,&#8221; for example, trades in his Ford for a Buick, and,<br />
when he becomes an &#8220;Executive,&#8221; trades in his Buick for a Cadillac. The<br />
&#8220;Career Woman&#8221; needs an entirelv different wardrobe than the one she owned<br />
as a &#8220;Housewife.&#8221;  And when the man of the house gets a raise, the house<br />
either grows bigger, or prettier, or more filled with status-definers of<br />
every description—or the house itself is discarded, to be replaced by<br />
one more befitting the new character of its possessor.  How to Put These<br />
Longings for Identification to Work for Your Product Thus products become<br />
more than products. In addition to their physical functions, they take on<br />
new immaterial functions as status definers. They announce our achievements,<br />
define our role in life, document our success.  All products may benefit<br />
from this power to define. But in particular, when you have a product that<br />
does the same job as its</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>115</p>
<p>competitors, and is so priced that price is no longer a factor, then the<br />
prospect&#8217;s choice will almost overwhelmingly depend on the difference in<br />
role that your product offers him. And it is vour job to create this role<br />
for him in your ad.  The performance of this job—the process of building<br />
these character and achievement roles into vour product, to be used bv<br />
vour prospect—is the process of Identification, our second mechanism of<br />
persuasion.  And just as the wish for this identification by vour prospect<br />
is a special form of desire—the desire, not for satisfaction, but for<br />
recognition—so the method vou use to put it to work for your product follows<br />
exactly the same pattern of discovery and magnification that you would use<br />
for anv other desire.  First, your job is to discover exactly what kinds of<br />
character and achievement roles vour prospect is readv to identify with vour<br />
product—what kind of roles he will reject for that product—and which<br />
of the accepted roles is the most compelling.  And then you must present<br />
those chosen roles in such a wav— so vividly and so intensely—that the<br />
role vou are projecting will become virtually irresistible.  Once again,<br />
it is vour market itself that presents vou with both your opportunities<br />
and vour limitations. And it is vour own personal skill as a copy writer<br />
that determines how effectively vou side-step those limitations, and how<br />
fullv you realize the potential of vour opportunities.  First of all—the<br />
limitations. Above everything else, of course, you cannot force your market to<br />
accept an unrealistic identification. People assign certain characteristics<br />
to certain products.  These characteristics may arise out of the product<br />
itself—its structure or performance, its historv, its cost to produce or<br />
sell. Or thev may stem from the role or roles that it plavs in their lives<br />
today—or that similar products play in their lives—or that these products<br />
plav in the lives of other people, whom thev have seen, heard or read about.<br />
These characteristics may be true or false, superficial or</p>

<p>profound, flattering or libelous. But as far as your product is concerned,<br />
they are as hard as rock—and just as determinative. They exist. They are<br />
facts. They cannot be changed. If you try to break through them and establish a<br />
contradictory image, vou will learn that they form the walls of a prison.  But<br />
if you decide to build on to them—to use them as a foundation for sharper,<br />
coordinated images, which may be even broader and more appealing—then, if<br />
necessary, you can turn those apparent limitations into the strongest selling<br />
points in your ad.  Not every product needs this technique, of course. Speaking<br />
in terms of identification potential, there are two kinds of products. One<br />
is the product with built-in prestige—the sports car, the swimming pool,<br />
the diamond bracelet. These rare and expensive products already embody the<br />
identification appeals most Americans want. They actually symbolize these<br />
appeals success, achievement, adventure, self-indulgence, exclusivity—so<br />
unquestionably that they can be used to weld these same values onto other<br />
products.  But these other products—by far the overwhelming majority of the<br />
products you will be given to work with—have no such built-in prestige. It<br />
is up to you to create their prestige for them.  And you must do this by<br />
building on the characteristics they already possess—by using these accepted<br />
characteristics as a bridge—between the product. . . the image it already<br />
has . . . and the prestige-filled image that you want to wind up \vith.<br />
We now have all the tools we need to build identification values for our<br />
product. We realize that identification longings are a separate and immensely<br />
powerful form of desire—a desire, not for physical satisfaction, but for<br />
expression and recognition.  These longings for identification are two-fold. We<br />
all wish to express our character, and we all wish to gain recognition for<br />
our accomplishments.  But we cannot do this openly—verbally. We cannot go<br />
around boasting how virile we are, or how rich we are. So we svmbolize</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>these prestige claims. We express them in terms ol products— and we buy<br />
products that express them.  As Americans, living in our culture and our<br />
century, there are certain character roles and certain achievement roles<br />
that we value more than others. The most general and compelling of these<br />
are: the wish to be virile or feminine—the wish to be exciting, unique,<br />
fun-filled and adventurous—the wish to be friendly and well-liked—the<br />
wish to be important, influential and correct— the wish to be modern and<br />
up-to-date—and. above all, the wish to be successful, to make something<br />
of our lives.  These are the roles most Americans buv. In some splinter<br />
markets, other, contradictory roles mav apply. But, in the mass, these are<br />
the characteristics that will turn the prospects from one brand to another.<br />
The Primary Image of Your Product There is a critical point that separates<br />
the process of building identification from the process of building desire,<br />
namely, that the product you are given has its men personality at the moment<br />
you are given it. It has its own characteristics. And these characteristics<br />
may contradict what most Americans want—or simply not include them—or<br />
simply not include as many of them as you want.  For example, a cigarette<br />
is not, by itself, a symbol of success.  But vou realize that if you could<br />
make it a symbol of success, you could sell many more of them. Nor is a<br />
piston ring, by itself, a svmbol of virility—even though that virility<br />
image, if vou could create it, would sell manv more piston rings. And,<br />
though household appliances are not, at first glance, symbols of femininity,<br />
women would buv manv more of them if thev could somehow be made feminine.<br />
How do you do this? In two steps—the first of which is to identify the<br />
primary image that each of these products already has in the mind of your<br />
prospects. For instance, a cigarette is</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>virile in almost everyone&#8217;s mind. And a piston ring is precisionmachined and<br />
full of mechanical beauty to almost every man.  And household appliances<br />
are time-saving, by virtue of tlie ven functions they perform.  These are<br />
the primary images of the products vou are called on to sell. These are the<br />
accepted images that thev alreadv have in your prospect&#8217;s mind. Your job<br />
now is to use &#8216;these alreadvaccepted images as raw material, as a starting<br />
point to construct new, double, triple and quadruple images, that draw in<br />
more of these most-wanted roles into your product-personality, and multiply<br />
its identification appeal.  You do this in two wavs: First, by changing the<br />
intensity of your primary image. Bv emphasizing and dramatizing that primary<br />
image, if it is alreadv acceptable. Or by toning it down, if it is negative<br />
or neutral.  For example, the male virility naturally associated witli<br />
cigarettes is a definite sales aid, even with women. The sheer physical act<br />
of smoking—of &#8220;playing with fire&#8221;—of &#8220;breathing fire&#8221;—has been for<br />
centuries an assertion of manhood and of daring.  But Marlboro took this<br />
image of virilitv- and intensified i t deepened it—in three ways. First,<br />
they presented men who were.  in themselves, virile. Second, they presented<br />
these men in situations or occupations that demand virility. And third,<br />
thev took the further &#8220;Creative Gamble&#8221; of affixing to these men&#8217;s hands one<br />
of the most primitive symbols of virilitv- known to history—the tattoo.<br />
A single dominant emotion—virilitv-—symbolized three ways.  The impact<br />
of repetition reinforced through variation. Far more powerful—far more<br />
eye-catching—far more appealing than anyone of these images could have<br />
been by itself.  So far, there has been no difference between this technique<br />
and the intensification of desire we discussed previously. Although we are<br />
speaking here in visual terms, the mechanics are exactly the same—the<br />
intensification of an already-existing emo-</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F<br />
I C A T I O N</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>tion in your prospect, through a series of reinforcing images expressing the<br />
fulfillment of that emotion.  With certain, naturally-favored products, this<br />
process of intensification may be all that is required—though even Marlboro,<br />
as mentioned below, goes beyond it. But—and this point is imperative—though<br />
the process of intensifying desire for your product ends here, the process of<br />
building the proper identification for your product—of building prestige for<br />
that product—only- begins here.  For the primary image of vour product may<br />
not be favorable. It may be negative—contradicting the roles most people<br />
want to play. Or it may simply be neutral—a wallflower product—offering<br />
most people no emotional reaction at all.  In both these cases, your first<br />
suggestion may be to simply discard these primary images altogether, and<br />
substitute more favorable ones. This has been done in countless advertisements.<br />
And it doesn&#8217;t work—for a very simple reason. Because people just won&#8217;t<br />
believe that a product is what it isn&#8217;t. You cannot contradict accepted<br />
images or beliefs in advertising. This is not advertising&#8217;s role. Nor is<br />
it really necessary.  In order to overcome these unfavorable images, you<br />
simply incorporate them in a larger, overall image—lower their emotional<br />
intensity—and use them as readily-accepted bridges to lead your prospect into<br />
far more compelling appeals.  How to Build New Images Into Your Product This is<br />
a single process, but it is made up of two steps. First, as mentioned above,<br />
a change in the intensity of your primaryimage—in this case, subordinating<br />
it even though you retain it.  And second, using it as a logical link to bring<br />
in any number of more favorable images.  One of the most striking examples is<br />
the Chesterfield ad of 1926—&quot;Blow Some My Wax&quot;—fully examined in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>Here is pure identification advertising—dealing with an unfavorable image of<br />
two generations&#8217; standing—that cigarettes are a &#8220;man&#8217;s product.&#8221; Although the<br />
objective of the campaign was to make smoking, and smoking situations, more<br />
acceptable to women, it would have been impossible to do this bv picturing<br />
the woman alone. The idea that women would practice this Masculine act<br />
in private, or with each other, was inadmissible. Therefore the man must<br />
be retained. The accepted image must be acknowledged.  But he undergoes<br />
two vital transformations. First, he is subdued. His figure is darkened,<br />
almost blended into invisibility with the background. And his position in<br />
the picture—his posture— the arrangement of his hands and face as the<br />
light plavs over them—all direct the attention of the viewer past the man<br />
himself and into the focal point of the picture, the woman sitting beside him.<br />
Thus he becomes a mere suggestion of man, leading the viewer into a far more<br />
appealing overall image—that of a handsome young couple, alone together<br />
on a moonlit beach, heightened emotionally with the carefully-blended-in<br />
suggestions of escape, intimacy, and a sense of shared daring.  Because<br />
the primary image is there—because the smoking is done by the man—the<br />
viewer, even a well-brought up woman of the 1920s, accepts the situation. But<br />
this acceptance, once established, goes far beyond that primary image. This<br />
feminine viewer is also willing to accept the romance of the overall scene—<br />
including its emotional undertones of escape from the conventional rules and<br />
boundaries, and its feelings of relaxation and liberty. She is now willing<br />
to project herself into this scene.  And in accepting the scene as a whole,<br />
she is finally led to accepting the climactic words, &#8220;Blow some mv way,&#8221;<br />
as being a perfectly natural and acceptable action for her to take, with all<br />
its implications for her conduct in the future.  This, then, is the process<br />
of identification—of building prestige for your product. To weave favorable<br />
social and character</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>121</p>
<p>images into the personality of your product, in order to reinforce and even<br />
dominate those primary images that your product already has.  There is onlv<br />
one limit to the number, or the range of favorable images that vou can add<br />
to that product personality. Simply that you must always include the primary<br />
image as their base.  They must emerge from that primary image, and thev<br />
must be logically consistent with its broadest definition.  For example, to<br />
return to Marlboro, once vou have developed the primary image to its peak of<br />
intensity then there is absolutely nothing to stop vou from weaving other<br />
powerful appeals into this base. Connotations of success can be included<br />
bv the model&#8217;s clothes, such as the tuxedo worn in the first ads, or bv<br />
the possessions he holds. Adventure and excitement can be suggested by the<br />
situation you picture him in, such as on a boat, in a plane, riding horseback,<br />
etc. Romance bv a voung girl, mvsterv and affairs of great importance bv a<br />
dark background or a briefcase, culture and intellectual achievement bv a<br />
rare book or an antique telescope.  As a matter of fact, many visual symbols,<br />
bv themselves, communicate several different roles of great appeal at the<br />
same time.  For example, the single image of ownership of a fine painting<br />
mav express, not only success, but also cultural breeding and intellectual<br />
accomplishment.  Such multi-image symbols perform two vital tasks for vour<br />
product. They broaden the size of its market bv grafting on new emotional<br />
appeals—social and character identifications that reach into the fringe<br />
areas of that market—that intrigue people who would not be sufficiently<br />
swaved bv the pure functional values of your product. And second, bv adding<br />
in these manv-sided emotional images, thev deepen and intensify the emotional<br />
attraction felt for your product bv all the men and women who make up that<br />
market.  Perhaps this can best be shown bv taking a hypothetical example,<br />
of a product with strictly neutral primary images, and</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>developing, and weaving together, a network of far stronger emotional images<br />
for it.  Let&#8217;s start with piston rings, and assume that a new tvpe of piston<br />
ring has just been developed, that lasts longer and therefore saves oil and<br />
gas. Our body copy, of course, develops this saving theme. We have exploited<br />
the functional advantages of the product as far as possible. We are now ready<br />
to reinforce these benefits by expanding the product&#8217;s social and character<br />
appeals.  We start by taking inventory. We have a prodiret—piston rings. It<br />
has only a few primary images—mechanical, precisionmade, unseen. Nothing<br />
exciting here. It also has a primary situation—replacement, and always<br />
by a mechanic, and usually onlv when there&#8217;s trouble.  These primary images<br />
are either neutral or negative. But they&#8217;re all we have to work with. They,<br />
and they alone, must form the foundation, must set the direction, for<br />
every other appeal we bring into the over-all image we are constructing.<br />
So we know that we must deal with the act of replacement, and that the<br />
replacement must be done by a mechanic. These are our limitations—but once<br />
we observe them, we turn them into the starting point for the true emotional<br />
message ice want to broadcast through our ad. We take each of these primary<br />
elements, and glamorize, dramatize and emotionalize them to the brink.<br />
The car itself—what kind of car shall it be? Certainly not a beat-up<br />
family sedan. Why not a Mercedes SL-300—a $12,000 sports car with its<br />
distinctive grill-work sides, and all the emotional extras of power, speed,<br />
skill-in-handling, plus sophistication, success and downright excitement.<br />
Now the garage—what should it look like? A sports-car shop, of course. Neat,<br />
clean, precise. With high-power equipment gleaming chrome and steel—hanging<br />
on the walls, ready on the shelves, being installed on other sports models<br />
in the background.  The mechanic is not young, not old, simply mature. Rugged,</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F<br />
I C A T I O N</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>knowledgeable, precise. He&#8217;s sure of what he&#8217;s doing—there isn&#8217;t a wasted<br />
motion or a wasted tool anywhere about him.  The owner of the car is young,<br />
wiry, yirile, but he too has been around. (Put into words, these images<br />
must take on a measure of disbelief, which we express by saying they&#8217;re<br />
&#8220;corny.&#8221;  However, expressed in visual terms, where they can be symbolized,<br />
and therefore implied rather than named, they enter into our minds unnoticed,<br />
and we accept them without question. Verbal terms—words and sentences—can<br />
be used to imply images of identification; but these are different tvpes<br />
of images, and must be conveyed in a different way. We will touch on this<br />
verbal image building again, as related to excitement and mood, in Chapter 14.<br />
The owner is not a professional driver, but he races the car for sport (we<br />
know this bv the roll-over bar over the back of the seats). He loves this<br />
car (its perfect shine, its gleaming chrome engine, its complete absence of<br />
even a spot of dirt). He too is precise (the chronometer on his wrist). And<br />
he carries his success with a complete casualness (the absence of anv<br />
special driving outfit—just slacks and a sport shirt).  And what about<br />
the relationship between the two men?  Knowledge complementing skill. The<br />
expert in one field advising the expert in another. Comfort, understanding,<br />
teamwork—leading to mutual achievement.  And what are thev doing? Replacing<br />
rings, of course. But not because the old rings have developed trouble<br />
(nothing in this car would be left unchecked long enough to have developed<br />
a flaw). But because this mechanic is installing these new rings in this car<br />
as high-performance equipment, exactly as he would install a supercharger to<br />
increase its horsepower.  Everything about the picture—its camera angle,<br />
its composition, its lighting, the angle of the men&#8217;s heads and arms as thev<br />
examine the rings—develops the emotion of precision and the excitement<br />
and drama of discovering new performance through greater and greater precision.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>It is a picture, a situation and a mood that invites participation. The<br />
reader may not notice every emotional detail that you have developed; but<br />
he will sense the excitement and pleasure that you have built up. He will<br />
wish to share in this world.  And he will buy the product that gives him<br />
this world—that offers it as a bonus to all its functional and physical<br />
satisfactions.  On the Limits to the Images Your Prospects Will Identify<br />
With I must insert a warning here. Although these identification images<br />
are immensely powerful when used correctly, there arc also strict rules<br />
and limits to their use. And, if they are used incorrectly, they can be<br />
disastrous.  Many campaigns have collapsed because they have asked their<br />
market to identify themselves with an unbelievable image.  For example,<br />
the deodorant-soap campaign of several vears ago that used an elite, society<br />
image to sell the mass market. The men and women who composed the market could<br />
not make the jump between themselves and the characters pictured in the ad.<br />
And they not only refused to believe the suggested identification.  but the<br />
disbelief spread to the performance claims themselves.  and killed the sales.<br />
The key to avoiding such mistakes, of course, is the structure of the word,<br />
unbelievable. What makes an image—or a claim, or an idea—believable or<br />
not believable? We shall discuss this question thoroughly in the next few<br />
chapters. However, in relation to image-building, the answer lies in two<br />
points: 1. What do people already believe about the personality of your<br />
product? Do they believe, today, that it has the character traits that you<br />
say it has? And—if they do—can they identify themselves, their lives,<br />
their present position in society, or their next step up in society with<br />
these traits?  If the answer to both these questions is Yes, then you can</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>use the image exactly as you&#8217;ve conceived it. If, however, either one<br />
of the answers is No, then vou must move on to the second step: 2. What<br />
other primary image do I have to use as a believability-bridge to connect<br />
what my prospect already believes with what I want him to believe when he<br />
finishes my ad? If he doesn&#8217;t believe that mv product has those desirable<br />
character traits, then I have to start with what he already believes. I have<br />
to use these images as a base, and build up to my desired overall image,<br />
as we discussed before.  And, in addition, if mv prospect believes that<br />
my product does possess these target-traits, but doesn&#8217;t believe that they<br />
relate to his life, as it exists in either the present or the future, then<br />
again I have to use a bridge-image. I have to insert a firstseen image that<br />
he can immediately identify with, and use that acceptable identification<br />
as^a hook to hang my target-image on to.  For example, in the Marlboro ad,<br />
men who would never identify themselves immediately with a yachting costume<br />
or an opera hat, accepted the image completely after it was introduced by<br />
the acceptable virility concept of the male model smoking the cigarette.<br />
If you demand that your prospect jump across a believabilitychasm, vour ad<br />
will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that<br />
chasm—starting on his side—then he will let vou lead him almost anywhere.<br />
On Saleable Identifications Springing From the Physical Product Itself We<br />
mentioned in Chapter 2 that for the purposes of preparing an advertisement,<br />
everv product can be considered to be two products. There is the functional<br />
product—what the product does for the consumer. And there is the physical<br />
product— what the consumer actually gets. In tapping mass desire, we put</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p>aside the physical product, and concentrated on functional performances. Now,<br />
in searching for image-sources to build powerful identifications, we<br />
re-examine the physical product itself lhe physical product can be broken<br />
down into three sem lc rate areas: 1. Its appearance; 2. Its components<br />
and structure; and 3. The technical background from which it emerged Each<br />
one of these areas has image potential. In each one of them you may find<br />
strong primary images that already exist Or m each one of them you may be<br />
able to graft on related images that will greatly increase the sales of<br />
your product For example, the appearance of&#8217;vour product. As you receive it,<br />
that product&#8217;s appearance is probably determined by function. Lets say that<br />
the product is mechanical, like a car In this case, its appearance will be<br />
a combination of what it has to do (ro 1 on a highway, carry six people,<br />
shelter them against wind and rain, etc.), and the cheapest practical way of<br />
doing it. Out of this combination of performance and^ economy comes the raw<br />
shell of your c a r &#8211; i t s basic functional appearance. It is at this point<br />
that you start to build in the images.  You do this in two ways. First, you<br />
exploit the dramatic primary images that already exist in the extreme forms<br />
of your product. For cars, for instance, you borrow from the glamour c a r s<br />
the severe streamlining and stabilizing fin of the racing c a r &#8211; t h e hub<br />
caps and wheel wells of the sports c a r &#8211; t h e exhaust ports and roof line<br />
of the custom car. And you blend their feeling of excitement and power and<br />
distinction into the family sedan But this is only the first step. Once you<br />
have exploited the already-existing primary images in your product-if there<br />
are any-you then begin to weave in other images that have absolutely nothing<br />
to do with the necessary physical structure of your product. And you alter<br />
the appearance of your product to accommodate and express these images.  &#8217; &#8217;</p>
<p><span class="caps">SECOND</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: I D E N T I F I C A T I O N</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>For example, many products are chemical rather than mechanical. They are<br />
liquids, powders, sprays, granulates, etc. Therefore their physical appearance,<br />
to the manufacturer, is completely arbitrary. Outside of the need to hold<br />
them together and shield them against wear, their physical package can take<br />
any shape you wish.  Here, of course, there are no primary images arising<br />
from functional appearance at all. All the images that you wish to shape into<br />
vour package must be borrowed. And where do you borrow them from? From the<br />
background of your product. Or from its components. Or from the values of<br />
society as a whole.  For example, the product&#8217;s background. One of the most<br />
brilliant packaging concepts in years was Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Micrin. Here<br />
was a mouth wash—a liquid—sold in drug stores and supermarkets—whose<br />
effectiveness far exceeded any similar product ever sold before. How were thev<br />
to convey that effectiveness to the consumer at a glance?  They simply took<br />
the physical shape of glass containers that are found only in doctors&#8217; offices<br />
and operating rooms, and transcribed that exact shape onto an over-the-counter<br />
product. Use this shape to house an ice-blue liquid, that in itself suggests<br />
medical cleanliness, and you have a product that says instantly, &#8220;This is<br />
doctor&#8217;s-liquidNThis is medicine. This works.&#8221;  Here the background of the<br />
product is symbolized in the product&#8217;s container. So effectively that the<br />
container itself becomes the finest image-illustration that the agency could<br />
use in creating their ad. Where the background of your product contains<br />
elements that inspire excitement, drama, quality or helievahilitij to your<br />
prospect, then those elements should he expressed either in the product<br />
itself, or in its package, or in its ad.  The same hypothesis holds true for<br />
the components that make up your product. If vour product has electronic<br />
components, for example, it should have an electronic flavor to both its<br />
appearance and its advertising. Shoiv the radar installations, guided mis-</p>

<p>How to Make Your Prospect Believe Your Claims Before You State Them As we<br />
have learned before, for the purpose of persuasion, the human mind may be<br />
divided into three dimensions—three great rivers of emotional force that<br />
determine the reaction to your ad, and therefore its success or failure.<br />
The first of these dimensions is Desire—want, yearning, motivation—with<br />
specific goals and/or cures in mind—with the prospect begging to be<br />
shown how to obtain them. It is the copy writer&#8217;s job to make sure the<br />
path to these goals goes through the product—and to make sure that the<br />
prospect can visualize every drop of satisfaction that their achievement<br />
will give him.  The second dimension is Identification—the need for<br />
expression and recognition—unformulated, unspoken, at least partially<br />
unconscious—searching for symbols, definitions and embodiments. It is the<br />
copv writer&#8217;s job to crystallize these self-</p>

<p>definitions and emboch&#8217; them in his product—so that the product may be used,<br />
not only as a source of physical satisfaction, but also as a symbolic extension<br />
of the personality of the prospect for whom it is intended.  Until now, this<br />
book has been concerned with these first two dimensions. They have determined<br />
the selection of our headline.  and our illustration, and most of the content<br />
of our ad.  But—important as they are—desire and identification alone<br />
are never enough. By themselves, they can never produce the full reaction<br />
the copy writer must have if he is to achieve the maximum success with his<br />
product. No matter how intense the desire.  no matter how demanding the need<br />
to identify, both these reactions must be fused with a third great emotional<br />
force—Belief— before they can produce the final overwhelming determinant of<br />
action—Absolute Conviction.  It is this fusion of desire and belief—this<br />
conviction—this certainty—this feeling in the prospect of being right in<br />
his choice— of being assured of what he has been promised—that the cop,/<br />
writer seeks as his ultimate goal.  And it is to this third dimension of the<br />
human mind—the Belief that produces this certainty—that we now turn.<br />
What Exactly Is Belief?  It is perhaps the most complex fusion of thought<br />
and emotion in the human mind. It is, first of all, your prospects mental<br />
picture of the world he lives in—what facts make it up, how it works, in<br />
what direction its truths and values lie.  But these accepted facts, truths,<br />
values and opinions are only the raw material of belief. Even more important<br />
is the vast amount of emotional security he derives from these beliefs. It is<br />
the wonderful feeling of comfort and reassurance of living in a world that<br />
has meaning, where there are answers to be had.  where somehow the facts<br />
all fit. A world that he can understand and depend on, that he can predict,<br />
that will stav together and</p>

<p>not blow up in his face tomorrow morning or the morning after that.  Do not<br />
be misled for even a moment. The need to believe— and the need for secure<br />
beliefs—is just as powerful an emotional force as the strongest desire for<br />
physical satisfaction, or the most urgent search for expression.  Most adults<br />
have done their basic learning of these beliefs when they were children. At<br />
that time, and in that dependent stage of their lives, they laid down the<br />
primary channels of belief that their minds would follow for the rest of<br />
their days. They were forced to do this, in order to understand the world,<br />
to gain its approval, to trust and master it, and to develop themselves<br />
into self-sustaining adults.  To ask them to shatter even one of these<br />
alreadv-established lines of belief—to plunge into uncertainty again—to<br />
be forced to reassemble their beliefs in new, untested ways—is to ask them<br />
to become children again. And—unless they are &#8220;frightened beyond belief,&#8221;<br />
unless their entire conceptual world has crumbled around them—thev simply<br />
will not do it.  The basic rule of belief, then, can simply be stated as<br />
this: If vou violate vour prospect&#8217;s established beliefs in the slightest<br />
degree—either in content or direction—then nothing you promise him, no<br />
matter how appealing, can save your ad.  But, on the other hand, and even more<br />
important: If you can channel the tremendous force of his belief—either in<br />
content or direction—behind only one claim, no matter how small, then that<br />
one fully-believed claim will sell more goods than all the half-questioned<br />
promises vour competitors can write for all the rest of their days. This<br />
channeling of belief is so powerful that, if properlv directed, it will even<br />
support othenvise-absurd claims.  It is simply a question of whether you are<br />
going to paddle upstream or down. Whether vou are going to work against the<br />
tide of established belief, or with it.  As far as advertising is concerned,<br />
then, belief is immutable.</p>

<p>It cannot be changed. It must be complied with at everv step.  Every one of<br />
the statements you make in vour ad must fit in with your prospects version<br />
of &#8220;the facts&#8221; at that precise moment. It is not the function of your ad to<br />
change those facts.  But it is its function—and one of its great sources<br />
of strength— to extend them. To build a bridge of belief between those<br />
facts as they exist in your prospect&#8217;s mind today—and the ultimate facts<br />
your prospect must believe if he is to accept your claims.  This process of<br />
starting with the facts that vour prospect is already willing to accept, and<br />
leading him logically and comfortably through a gradual succession of more and<br />
more remote facts—each of which he has been prepared in turn to accept—<br />
is called Gradualization. It is the third Process of Persuasion.  Mind you,<br />
this process of Gradualization has nothing to do with the offering of proof,<br />
or reason-why explanations, or testimonials or documentation. Each of these<br />
mechanisms of belief adds to the power of your ad, and we will explore each of<br />
them in turn in the chapters that follow.  In Chapter 11, we will discuss the<br />
verbal demonstration that your product does what you claim—Mechanization.<br />
In Chapter 12, we will discuss the destruction of alternate ways of satisfying<br />
that same desire—Concentration.  In Chapter 14, we will discuss the offering<br />
of authorities and proof, the reassurance that your prospect has made a wise<br />
c h o i c e Verification.  All these devices build belief. But by far the<br />
most fundamental of all—though the most inconspicuous—is Gradualization.<br />
For Gradualization determines—not the content of your ad—but its structure,<br />
its architecture, the way i/ou build it.&#8217;  We have already seen that it is<br />
the&#8217;dominating desire of your prospect that determines the content of vour<br />
ad. It is his longings for identification and self-expression that, in most<br />
cases, determine your illustrations.  But it is the facts that he believes in<br />
and accepts, and the way that he passes that acceptance along from one fact to</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>133</p>
<p>another, that determines that ad&#8217;s development—the arrangement of your<br />
claims and your images and vour proofs, so that there is a step-bv-step<br />
strengthening—not only of your prospect&#8217;s desire— but of his conviction<br />
that the satisfaction of that desire will come true through your product.<br />
The Architecture of Belief In essence, then, the theory of Gradualization<br />
is based upon this fact: That every claim, everv image, every proof in your<br />
ad has two separate sources of strength— 1. The content of that statement<br />
itself; and 2. The preparation vou have made for that statement—either by<br />
recognizing that preparation as already existing in your prospect&#8217;s mind,<br />
or bv deliberately laving the groundwork for that statement in the preceding<br />
portion of the ad itself.  And, because of this fact, we can strengthen the<br />
power of each of these statements in two separate ways— 1. Bv increasing<br />
the intensity of its content—by making greater promises, bv portraying<br />
more dramatic images, by offering more compelling proof; and/or 2. Bv<br />
changing the place or position or sequence in which that statement occurs<br />
in the ad—by strengthening the groundwork for belief in that statement<br />
by the material which precedes it—and therefore increasing the intensity<br />
of belief given to it— the immediate acceptance of its content, without<br />
question, when the prospect encounters it in vour ad.  Make no mistake,<br />
it is this acceptance that we are looking for. Effective advertising, like<br />
effective literature, is built—not of words—but of reactions. We put down<br />
on paper an architecture of words. If these words are effective, they evoke,<br />
in turn, an architecture of reactions in our prospect&#8217;s mind. We are creating<br />
a stream of acceptances, with a definite sequence and content and direction,<br />
and, if we are successful, with a definite goal—the</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>absolute conviction in your prospects mind that he must have your product.<br />
This is the essence of building your ad. We now turn to the techniques of its<br />
accomplishment.  A New Definition of Awareness We now know that Gradualization<br />
is the art of starting your ad with a statement that will be immediately and<br />
entirely accepted, and then building a chain of subsequent acceptances upon<br />
this first statement. The purpose of this chain of acceptances is to lead your<br />
reader to a goal conclusion, which he will then accept, but which he would not<br />
as readily or as thoroughly have accepted without the preliminary statements.<br />
This quest for acceptance begins, of course, with vour headline. This<br />
all-important first statement that you make—this meeting place between your<br />
story and your prospect—must not only be capable of awakening interest<br />
and desire, but of being accepted at the very first glance as being true.<br />
Interest and believability—these are the two requirements that determine<br />
your headline. We have already discussed these requirements in Chapter 2,<br />
on the State of Awareness of our market.  We can now redefine this State of<br />
Awareness as readiness to accept. And we can now say—especially in the<br />
Fifth Stage of Awareness—that the effectiveness of your headline is as<br />
much determined by the willingness of your audience to believe what it says,<br />
as it is by the promises it makes.  This is the reason that you cannot always<br />
use the most powerful claim in your headline. Or even the very problem that<br />
your product solves. Because without supporting evidence already existing<br />
in the mind of your prospect to prepare him for that headline claim, he<br />
just won&#8217;t believe it. Either he&#8217;ll believe that it&#8217;s exaggerated or false,<br />
or he just won&#8217;t believe it applies to him.</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>135</p>
<p>In either case, too many of your prospects turn away without reading on, and<br />
your ad fails.  This fact—that your most powerful claim does not always<br />
make vour most powerful headline—is a paradox that many copy writers<br />
still cannot accept. Mail order advertisers, however, have a simple wav of<br />
proving it. When a power-claim headline doesn&#8217;t work—for reasons either of<br />
Awareness or Sophistication—they immediatelv split it against a second head,<br />
with far fewer claims in it, but far more likely to be believed. Then they<br />
build a beliefbridge from this second headline, to the same exact claims they<br />
had featured in the first, but now anticipated by careful preparation every<br />
step along the way.  A Detailed Example Let us take such an ad—that we<br />
have already glanced at in Chapter 2—and break down its structure step by<br />
step. What we are looking for here is not content, nor promises, nor claims;<br />
but the way these promises and claims arc arranged in the ad, to help each one<br />
of them gain full acceptance when it is encountered in turn by the prospect.<br />
This ad was written in 1951. Its purpose was to sell a Television Repair<br />
Manual. Theoretically, every TV owner who was having anv trouble with his<br />
set (and almost all of them were at that time) was a prospect. But, before<br />
the prospect could be turned into a customer, he had to believe two things:<br />
1. That he could save money by making his own TV repairs; and 2. That he<br />
was capable of making them.  Both these statements were matters of fact. The<br />
average TV owner certainlv could save money if he had made his own repairs;<br />
and about 80% of those repairs were simple enough for him to make himself.<br />
But the overwhelming majority of prospects simply didn&#8217;t</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>realize these facts. Most of them thought of themselves as nonhandymen,<br />
even in relation to far simpler devices than a television set. And, in 1951,<br />
the TV set was considered a complicated mechanical monster, far beyond their<br />
poor powers to understand let alone correct.  These two factors blocked the<br />
use of the obvious powerclaim headline for this product. Such a headline was<br />
written and tested—&quot;Save up to $100 a Year on Your TV Repairs!&quot;—but it<br />
failed to make a profit. The obvious was unsuccessful. Power alone could<br />
not move the product.  Two tasks faced the copy writer in revising this<br />
ad. First, he had to reach all his prospects in this market, and not just<br />
those among them who considered themselves handymen. And second, he had to<br />
convince all these non-handymen prospects that their sets weren&#8217;t really<br />
such fragile, complicated monsters after all, and that they themselves could<br />
easily correct most troubles that arose.  Once these two statements were<br />
believed by the prospect and only then—could the previous headline claim of<br />
&#8220;Save up to $100 a year on your TV repairs&#8221; be brought in at full power. Let<br />
us see, acceptance by acceptance, how this new ad built to that point: The<br />
headline, first of all, would have to be a general statement, crystallizing<br />
and exploiting the universal resentment against the high TV repair bills,<br />
the $60-a-vear TV service contracts that were then in existence, and the<br />
outright thievery that occurred in only a small fraction of the TV repair<br />
shops, but that had stigmatized the entire industry. From there—from this<br />
universallyaccepted resentment—the ad could then build toward the two goal<br />
conclusions listed above. Let us see how this was done, statement by statement.<br />
Here is the new headline: &#8220;<span class="caps">WHY</span> HAVEN&#8217;T TV <span class="caps">OWNERS</span> <span class="caps">BEEN</span> <span class="caps">TOLD</span> <span class="caps">THESE</span> <span class="caps">FACTS</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>137</p>
<p>No claim. No promise—except that of disclosure. But here is an implication of<br />
foul plav, which echoed the existing suspicion in the TV owner himself. Here is<br />
a crystallization and outright expression that the average owner felt toward<br />
being taken.  Facts have been withheld. This is something he can agree with!<br />
Thus, having achieved its first acceptance by its suspicionheadline, the ad<br />
reinforces that effect by an inclusion-question.  It asks a questions which,<br />
in form, seems to limit the market; but which, in content, actually assures the<br />
correct answer by the overwhelming majority of it: &#8220;Was i/our set purchased<br />
after the spring of 1947?&#8221;  95% of television owners would answer Yes. Thus<br />
the ad has built two acceptances in its first two sentences. It has started<br />
a Habit of Agreement in its reader. It now exploits that agreement by making<br />
its first definite promise in the third sentence: &#8220;Then here is the full,<br />
uncensored stonj of how yon can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills—avoid<br />
those $30-$60 a year service fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear<br />
pictures you&#8217;ve dreamed about!&#8221;</p>
<p>H o w Belief Was Built Into the Opening This is the ad&#8217;s first claim. Its<br />
content alone is extremelv powerful. But that powerful content—which<br />
otherwise might drive many readers awav as being just too fantastic to<br />
be believed— has been given extra belief—has been loaned, as it were,<br />
extra belief—not only by the first two sentences that preceded it—but by<br />
these deliberate constructions in the statement itself: 1. By the grammatical<br />
construction, &#8220;Was your. . .&#8221; in the second sentence, and &#8220;Then . . .&#8221; in<br />
the third which by its very form generates belief. It does this by implying<br />
exclusion. It says that the promise will come true only in certain cases;<br />
that it will only work for television sets purchased after 1947; that the<br />
ad cannot make this promise for sets purchased earlier. Thus it adds</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E OF B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>credence to whatever statement follows it. Yon can feel this added<br />
believability yourself by taking out the lead-word &#8220;Then&#8221; from the sentence<br />
and reading it again. Immediately, it loses half its force—force added to<br />
the content of the statement by the grammatical-bridge tying it in to the<br />
first two acceptances.  2. The second attempt at adding believabilitv is bv<br />
the descriptive nature of the promise. It is not onlv a promise of reward<br />
(the money saved), but a catalog of almost-universal symptoms (repair bills<br />
and service fees). Since the overwhelming majority of set owners are suffering<br />
from these problems, their descriptions evoke two more &#8220;Yes—I have them&#8221;<br />
reactions from the reader, and carry these reactions over to the save-monev<br />
claims that immediately follow them. If these descriptions were eliminated,<br />
the money-saving claims would be much weaker: &#8220;Then here is the full,<br />
uncensored story of liow you can save $15-$20—save $30-$60—save $90-$<br />
100 on your&#8217; TY set—and still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you&#8217;ve<br />
dreamed about!&#8221;  3. And finally, even though the causes of the set owner&#8217;s<br />
problems are specifically described, the cures for them are deliberately<br />
left ambiguous. The fact that thev will save otherwise wasted money, that<br />
they will get improved reception, is included— how they will do this<br />
is not. The mechanism bv which these goals will be accomplished is left<br />
out. It is left out because the reader has not yet been prepared for it. If<br />
he were to learn, at this moment in the ad, that he had to make repairs on<br />
his set to save this money, the average reader would turn the page. So he is<br />
given specific symptoms, that he will agree he has, and specific savings by<br />
eliminating them, that are certainly logical to expect.  He may or may not<br />
accept all these three claims in the sentence completely; but the strength<br />
of their promise, the two or three or four acceptances that he has already<br />
given, and the implied disclosures still remaining in the body of the ad,<br />
should be enough to carry him on, to this next paragraph: &quot;How many times<br />
this week have you had to get up to fix</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>139</p>
<p>a jumpy TV picture? . . . How many times have you had to put up with<br />
ghosts? . . . How many times. . . .&quot;  Here again is reinforcement of<br />
belief—the description of universal symptoms—the coaxing out of a<br />
stream of agreements.  &#8220;Yes . . . Yes . . . Yes&#8221;—he must answer if he<br />
has had trouble with his set. A habit of acceptance is being built inside<br />
him. Trust is being formed, layer by laver—as each question poses a test,<br />
and each ves answer proves to the reader that the ad is talking about him.<br />
Already the ad is beginning to weave its pattern of promise and belief and<br />
then promise again. Now, with as many as seven or eight agreements behind<br />
it to establish a firm foundation of belief, the ad moves on to its next<br />
great promise: &#8220;90% Of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary!&#8221;  &#8220;All of these<br />
breakdowns may have seemed tragic to you at the moment they happened—but<br />
here is the real tragedy! Do you know that the same exact set that you now<br />
have in your front room . . . has been playing in manufacturer&#8217;s test rooms<br />
for months—and playing perfectly!&#8221;  Goal Conclusions The ad is now laving<br />
the1 basis for the first of its two goal conclusions—that TV sets are<br />
not fragile—that they have amazing endurance if they are properlv cared<br />
for. Only when the reader accepts this fact, can the ad go on to its second<br />
conclusion—that whatever minor breakdowns do occur can be easily handled bv<br />
the owner himself.  But the ad is still five paragraphs awav from any mention<br />
of the owner touching his set. First it must establish the dependability of<br />
the set; and it does this bv two methods. At the start, in the following two<br />
paragraphs, it gives graphic descriptions of the manufacturer&#8217;s own tests<br />
used to establish this dependability: &quot;These sets have been subjected to<br />
&#8216;Breakdown Tests&#8217; that would seem incredible to the average owner. They have</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><span class="caps">THIRD</span> <span class="caps">TECHNIQUE</span> OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>been tamed on for 24 hours a day—7 days a week 4 iceeks a month. Some<br />
of these sets have been naming without a moment&#8217;s pause for as much as 17<br />
months.  &quot;These sets have been tested against almost every conceivable type<br />
of viewing hazard. . . up to 120 miles away from the station . . . against the<br />
interference of an entire warehouse of electrical appliances . . . in special,<br />
steel-ribbed buildings, which ordinarily would produce several distinct ghosts.<br />
&#8220;And in almost every one of these cases, these sets have produced perfect,<br />
movie-clear pictures—without major breakdowns—for as much as one full<br />
year! Here are some of the reasons why:&#8221; Then, when the reader has fully<br />
visualized the impact of these test reports, the ad now turns to expert<br />
authority and logical construction to reinforce this belief. Notice in<br />
the next fewparagraphs how the ad picks up the already-accepted condition.<br />
&#8220;If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were . . .&#8221;, and uses that<br />
now-established condition to prove the series of statements that follow it:<br />
&#8220;What TV Experts Have Learned About Your Set!&#8221;  &#8220;If your set were properly<br />
cared for—as these sets were cared for in these tests—it need break down<br />
only once during the entire year! In other words, you may actually have to<br />
call in a repairman only once during the entire year You can save the $30-$60<br />
&#8217;service fees you are nowpaying—and you can save most of the SI OS 15<br />
repair bills.&#8221;  &#8220;If your set was properly cared for. if can actually give you<br />
perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days a year.  It can give you this<br />
perfect reception without special &#8217;electronic equipment—without the help of a<br />
repairman—up to 100 miles away from your station.&#8221;  Notice that in these two<br />
paragraphs, the ad returns to the claims made in the third sentence—repeats<br />
them almost word for word—and then gives logical proof, in logical form,<br />
for each of them. As we have pointed out before, these claims—&quot;you can<br />
avoid those $15-420 repair bills—avoid those $30-$60 a year service</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>141</p>
<p>fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear picture ijou&#8217;ve dreamed<br />
about!&#8220;—were stated in the third sentence without supporting proof at that<br />
time; but with strong implication—&#8221;Here is the full, uncensored. story<br />
. . .&#8220;—that such proof would follow.  That proof is now submitted, in an<br />
extremely formal and logical structure. Thus the ad again weaves proof into<br />
promise—repeating previous claims in a new context of full documentation,<br />
where it could only suggest that they would be proven before.  Notice also<br />
that this logical proof—&#8221;If your set were cared for. . . it need break down<br />
only once a year. . . you need call a repairman only once a year. . . you save<br />
the service fees and most repair bills.&#8220;—is, in itself, solidly grounded<br />
in the test-proof presented in the paragraphs before it—&#8221;being subjected<br />
to Breakdown tests . . . against almost every type of viewing hazard . . .<br />
and produced perfect pictures, without breakdowns, for as much as one full<br />
year&quot; Thus a chain of proof upon proof is constructed— each new statement<br />
repeating the heart of the proof before it.  Thus the ad has now proved—bv<br />
using the Mechanism of Intensification—by repeating the same theme-content<br />
seven different times in seven different wavs—that vour TV set is dependable.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Objective This was the first goal-conclusion. At this point the<br />
reader is convinced that it is true. The ad is now ready to go on to prove<br />
the second goal conclusion: that the owner can correct minor breakdowns<br />
himself.  It begins this proof in the verv next paragraph, in this way:<br />
&#8220;And, most important, these experts have discovered that you do not have to<br />
he a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this performance out of your<br />
set! Here&#8217;s why&#8221; Notice that it is in this paragraph that the entirely-new<br />
(to the reader) assumption—that vou can fix your own minor breakdowns—is<br />
first introduced. Yet its novelty is deliberately con-</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>cealed; it is presented as though it were simply another rephrasing of the<br />
bv-now already accepted dependability conclusion. There is therefore no<br />
break in the logical flow of proof. Acceptance is built into this entirely<br />
new statement in these four different ways: 1. By paragraph parallelism. By<br />
framing the statement as the last of a series of similar paragraphs—all the<br />
others of which have already been accepted—instead of physically setting it<br />
off as a new point with its own sub head and a different construction, as the<br />
reader would ordinarily expect.  2. By the lead word, &#8220;And,&#8221; a tie-in phrase,<br />
which indicates that the sentence accompanying it is the same as those that<br />
have gone before.  3. By immediately following &#8220;And&#8221; by a second tie-in phrase,<br />
&#8220;most important,&#8221; which again implies that the remainder of the statement is<br />
part of the series that has gone before.  4. And finally, by repeating the<br />
phrase, &#8220;these experts have discovered,&#8221; which echoes the identifying subhead<br />
at the beginning of the series, and carries on the acceptance-momentum of<br />
the series as a whole.  All these deliberate constructions combine to give<br />
this short, but vital, transitional paragraph the acceptance, and therefore<br />
the believability, of all the careful planning that has gone before it.<br />
They allow the reader to make what otherwise might be a jarring transition from<br />
already-established proof to an entirely new promise with a minimum of effort.<br />
Now the ad builds its final step—showing that the only repairs that the<br />
average owner will have to make are actually minor external adjustments on<br />
his set. Notice how it integrates this newextension of its previous thought<br />
into what has gone before bv starting with the phrase, once again, &quot;These<br />
experts have discovered . . . &quot; Here are the next three paragraphs: &#8220;Five<br />

<p>you learning signals before it has a major breakdown. For instance, after<br />
your set was installed, it probably played perfectly for the first week. But<br />
then it began to suffer from the vibration, the jarring, the interference of<br />
other electrical appliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to<br />
flop over or flicker—lines may appear on your screen.  &quot;Now—and this is<br />
important—if you had the knowledge to quickly make a few minor adjustments,<br />
on the outside controls of your set, then you could correct those symptoms, you<br />
could keep that set playing peifectly, and you could prevent major breakdowns<br />
in exactly the same way they were prevented in these manufacturers&#8217; tests.<br />
&#8220;If you do not have this knowledge . . . if you do not make these adjustments,<br />
then your set trill weaken, you will get a consistently bad picture, and<br />
you will have to call a repairman.&#8221;  The second goal-conclusion of the ad<br />
has now been reached.  At this stage of the copy, the reader now knows:<br />
f. That his set is dependable enough to ayoid major breakdowns during by far<br />
the greatest majority of the time he will playit; and 2. That if he obtains<br />
the proper knowledge, he can correct minor breakdowns himself, and help<br />
prevent the gradual formation of major breakdowns, by making a few simple<br />
adjustments to the outside controls of his set.  Therefore, the stage has now-<br />
been set for the final conclusion—the pay-off conclusion—a conclusion<br />
with all the inevitable logical force of a syllogism—that: 3. The owner<br />
should obtain this knowledge—make these minor adjustments himself—and<br />
therefore save the money he is paying today for sen-ice contracts, and save<br />
by far the greatest majority of the money he is paying for repair bills.<br />
Here is how this final conclusion is phrased by the copy: &#8220;It&#8217;s as simple<br />
as that. You pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge. If<br />
you had that knowledge yourself—then you would not have to pay him at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CRADLE</span></p>
<p>A Restatement of Our Basic Theory We have taken a great deal of space to<br />
analyze, in exact detail, one ad, and the structure of believabilitv that<br />
underlies the effectiveness of its claims.  We have done this for two reasons:<br />
1. To show how the goal-conclusion—the introduction of the product claim<br />
itself—may be made far more effective if it is delayed till the prospect has<br />
been prepared to accept it. And 2. To show how this full acceptance—this<br />
willingness to believe without question-can gradually be built up, layer<br />
by laver agreement by agreement, by use of the proper structure.&#8217; &#8217; Let us<br />
now state formally some of the rules we have dis covered in this analysis,<br />
and some of the devices vou can use time after time, to create the maximum<br />
structural believabiliti, tor each of your advertisements.  Here are the basic<br />
principles: Gradualization is the art of stating a claim in such a wav that<br />
it will receive the greatest possible acceptance and/or believabilitv from<br />
your prospect.  Belief ultimately depends upon structure. Just as desire<br />
depends upon promise, so belief in that promise depends upon the amount<br />
of preparation that promise has been given before vour reader is asked<br />
to accept it.  One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power<br />
often partially-believed promises. Most copy writers try to strengthen ads<br />
by piling promise upon promise. What thev usually get for their troubles<br />
is greater sales resistance from their prospects and trouble from the<br />
E T C . They could far better invest the same time in strengthening the<br />
believabilitu-structure of the original justifiable promise.  Now, how do<br />
you strengthen this believability-structure* What are the devices you can<br />
choose from to add believabilitv to any promise, in any ad?</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>145</p>
<p>Here are at least a few of them. Once vou get the feel of using them,<br />
you&#8217;ll probably develop a whole armorv of vour own.  1. The Inclusion<br />
Question Designed to permit immediate identification with vour storv.<br />
To show the prospect that you&#8217;re talking about him—not about someone else<br />
who would answer No to the question. Therefore, once he&#8217;s identified with<br />
the questions—once he&#8217;s made his first agreements with you and placed<br />
himself in the Yes-answer group— then your recommendations will have<br />
special meaning for him.  This is perhaps the most direct wav of building<br />
agreement at the beginning of the ad. It&#8217;s used everv day. For example,<br />
in this advertisement—highly successful—for a book called The Art of<br />
Selfishness: <span class="caps">ASK</span> <span class="caps">YOURSELF</span> <span class="caps">THESE</span> <span class="caps">NINE</span> <span class="caps">QUESTIONS</span> 1. Do you find it increasinglv<br />
difficult to cope with the world around you. . . .  2. Is your business or<br />
career a source of annoyance and frustration. . . .  3. Are you tormented<br />
by inadequacies, fear and embarrassments in your sex life. . . .  And so on.</p>
<p>2. Detailed Identification Another device used at the beginning of the ad, to<br />
establish immediate, and deep, agreement between the reader and the copy. Here,<br />
instead of asking questions to set up your Yes-train, you detail symptoms or<br />
problems that are your prospect&#8217;s reasons for desiring your product. Thus,<br />
again, your reader knows that vou are talking about him—that vou &#8220;have<br />
been there vourself&#8221;— and therefore that your recommendations will help<br />
answer these problems, his problems, that you have catalogued so well.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E OE B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CRADUALIZATIOX</span></p>
<p>For example, in this ad for a course to improve the prospect&#8217;s child&#8217;s grades<br />
in school: Let me explain. I don&#8217;t care whether your child is six years old<br />
or twenty—boy or girl—in grade school high school or college. It makes<br />
no difference how badly that child is doing in school today—how difficult<br />
it is for him to concentrate . . . how poor his memory mav be . . . howmuch<br />
a prisoner he is of crippling mental habits . . . how terrified he mav be<br />
of mathematics, or grammar, or social studi es, or even the hardest science<br />
course.  Of course, here—as in the Inclusion-Question—vour copv must be<br />
accurate. You must know enough about the reader&#8217;s problems to make every word<br />
you write ring true. If vou don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll shatter your believability-net,<br />
and he&#8217;ll simply&#8217; turn the</p>
<p>page.  So—before you write—research. Learn to know vour customer. This<br />
is alwavs the essential first step, in anv kind of copv</p>
<p>3. Contradiction of Present (False) Beliefs Again, used at the beginning of<br />
the ad. And again used to prepare a foundation for strong claim-statements<br />
that the reader might never accept raw. Here, you come bluntly out and say,<br />
&#8220;I know you think this is true; but I&#8217;m going to show <span class="caps">YOU</span> it&#8217;s false.&#8221;<br />
Best used, of course, in conjunction with strong authority strong enough to<br />
contradict present (unpleasant) beliefs, and get away with it.  For example,<br />
in an ad for cosmetics invented by a famous plastic surgeon: From this moment<br />
on, forget everything you have ever heard or read about what age &#8220;must do&#8221;<br />
to your appearance. Forget anything you have ever believed about how &#8220;old&#8221;<br />
you must look at thirty . . . forty . . . fifty . . . or even sixty. . . .</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Here vou are not looking for agreement as much as you are for a loosening<br />
of previous beliefs. You are saying that the old limitations are passing,<br />
and your next paragraph should be your first introduction of your positive<br />
claims, in somewhat the same way that this ad goes on: Because—starting<br />
with this moment—you are about to enter into a new world of beautv! A<br />
world where ordinary fruits are transformed into anti-wrinkle cosmetics.<br />
Where a. . . .  And so on.</p>
<p>4. The Language of Logic So far, the devices we have discussed have been<br />
used to build belief at the beginning of vour ad—to serve in the crucial<br />
transition from vour headline to the stream of intensified promises that<br />
vou are going to use to close the sale.  We have discussed the process<br />
of intensifying desire in Chapter 7. We now turn to the simultaneous,<br />
and equally important, task of maintaining belief in each new statement<br />
as you present it.  Here again, your objective is to build belief at the<br />
same exact time that vou build desire. To do this, you interlace each new<br />
promise tcith language-signals that show that it logically follows from<br />
everything that has been proved before. And that it therefore can be believed<br />
without hesitation.  What are these language-signals? They are, of course,<br />
the vocabulary of logic. They are the words we use when we reason: when we<br />
argue; when we prove our point in anv discussion, and force others to agree<br />
with us that we are right.  They are among the most powerful words in the<br />
English language—for the verv simple reason that they give the flavor of<br />
conviction to the promises into which we weave them.  These words have been<br />
used for centuries in court, in politics,</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>in science—even in detective stories—to that reason has been evitably<br />
follows from</p>
<p>that most-loved form of American fiction, show others that proof has been<br />
offered.  used, that one statement logically and inanother.</p>
<p>Therefore, after centuries of conditioning, the words themselves—regardless<br />
of the content of the statements to which thev are attached—now carry<br />
conviction. Therefore, thev should be woven throughout your ad, wherever<br />
thev logically apply.  For example, let&#8217;s look at some individual lines,<br />
in a number of different ads. Let&#8217;s see how each of these words (which<br />
I&#8217;ll italicize) gives a tone of reason and logic to those sentences in<br />
which they&#8217;re incorporated.  For example, in the famous Sherwin Codv ad:<br />
Why do so many find themselves at a loss for words to express their meaning<br />
adequately 0 The reason for this deficiency is clear. . . . Most persons do<br />
not write or speak good English simply because thev have never formed the<br />
habit of doing so. . . .  Or, in this ad for a book on how to manage difficult<br />
people: Take, as an example, the man who hahitualhj refuses to follow your<br />
instructions. There is a basic, underlying reason for this. Mr. Given shows<br />
you how to find that reason and then explains the means of correcting it. The<br />
whole solution can be surprisingly easy once you hate realized the underlying<br />
causes. . . .  Or, for a book on learning how to learn: . . . but simply<br />
by putting your <span class="caps">LOCKED</span>-UP <span class="caps">LEARNING</span> <span class="caps">POWERS</span> to work—today—as easily and<br />
logically as this. . . .  &#8217; &quot; &#8217; And so on. There are dozens of such phrases<br />
for vou to use.  Among them are: &#8220;This has been proved In/ thousands. . . .&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sound impossible? Not at all. It&#8217;s actually simple. . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">GRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>149</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s whtj. . . .&#8221;  &#8220;And, most important of all. is the fact that. . . .&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Therefore . . .&#8221;  &#8220;This was, without a doubt, the most thorough. . . .&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Thev discovered—in case after case—that. . . .&#8221;  This, again, is the<br />
language of logic. It is a language equally as filled with emotion as the<br />
language of desire. Interwoven into your promises, so subtly that the reader<br />
never even notices that it is there, it gives vour claims the invaluable<br />
air of conviction.</p>
<p>5. Svllogistic Thinking Now we go from the language of logic to the mechanisms<br />
of logic. This is the role that reason plays in your ad. This is the moment<br />
when you prove that your product works, through the mechanism of logical<br />
reasoning.  For example, in one of the most successful automotive accessory<br />
ads of all time, the copywriter wanted to prove that his spark plug was<br />
superior to the ordinary plug—even though it costs twice as much. Since<br />
the point of difference was simply that his plug delivered a larger spark,<br />
the copywriter built up his case in this way: Your car runs because gasoline<br />
is fed into the cylinders where a spark causes it to fire. This action<br />
causes the gas to explode . . . this explosion pushes down the piston.<br />
Now here is the important thing to you. The larger the spark is, the more<br />
powerful the explosion. The more powerful the explosion, the more power you<br />
get from your gasoline.  Poor explosion means wasted gas—loss of power,<br />
poor getaway, bad starting, a sluggish car.  Good explosion means more miles<br />
per gallon—more horsepower; a more exciting car to drive!  Notice the<br />
power of these three simple paragraphs. Power derived as much from their<br />
underlying formal structure as from</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>T H I R D T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CRADUALIZATION</span></p>
<p>their claims. One statement inevitably leads into another. Evenword is<br />
logical. There is a constant process of equation: spark to power, power to<br />
performance. Size equals power—and his plug delivers the largest size.<br />
Such structure—and the copv based on such a structure— develops the<br />
feeling of inevitability. The reader feels that the product must work. He<br />
has not onlv been told it works; he has been shown proof that it works.<br />
Such structure—though hidden behind the words it clothes itself in—is<br />
actually a physical entity. You can seek it out of hundreds of ads, if you<br />
look beneath the words themselves. You can trace it, codify it, and then repeat<br />
it. Once learned, it becomes a powerful tool in selling hundreds of products.<br />
We will explore these structures in more depth in the next two chapters—on<br />
Redefinition and Mechanization.  6. Other Belief Forms Once you grasp the<br />
fundamental idea that form—structure— determines believabilitv, then<br />
all sorts of opportunities open up to you. You realize that simply by the<br />
arrangement of i/our claims, you can add to their believabilitv.  For example:<br />
Contingency Structures—such as &#8220;If. . . then . . .&#8221;, or &#8220;Wis your&#8230;then&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
Repetition of Proof: Echoing—such as &quot;These experts found. . . . These<br />
experts found. . . . These experts found. . . . &quot; Promise—Belief—Promise<br />
Variation. Where every sentence of promise is followed (ideally) with another<br />
of proof, or verification, or documentation. So that the reader never has<br />
the breathing space to question.  Paragraph Parallelism. Where the same<br />
word structure used in an accepted statement is then picked up exactly,<br />
and used to borrow acceptance for a fresh claim.</p>

<p>151</p>
<p>There are manv more, of course. Some are words, some are chains of reasoning,<br />
some are merelv the physical arrangement of the copy on the page.  All have<br />
the same objective. To gain continued acceptance.  To prevent rejection. To<br />
build conviction. Belief is the goal.  Now let us look at some other methods<br />
of reinforcing it.</p>
<p>10 <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FOURTH</span> <span class="caps">TECHNIQUE</span> OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">REDEFINITION</span></p>
<p>How to Remove Objections to Your Product Time and time again, you are going<br />
to have to sell a product that has built-in handicaps. That— along with its<br />
promises and its functions—also has certain aspects to it that actually<br />
repel the prospect.  No product, of course, is perfect. If only for the<br />
reason that he must pav money for what you have to sell, your prospect<br />
starts with a basic minimum of resistance against buying your product.<br />
But this resistance is intensified by certain drawbacks in some products,<br />
often to the point where—unless you take definite action in your ad to<br />
redefine them—these drawbacks will actually kill your sale.  Let us now<br />
look at the three general categories of drawback, and then at the three<br />
types of redefinition that eliminates them.  First, of course, there is the<br />
product that is (or that sounds) too complicated—too hard to use.  153</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F I N I T I O N</p>
<p>Second, there is the product that is not important enough— whose basic<br />
appeal doesn&#8217;t have a statistically broad enough market.  And third,<br />
there is the product that just costs too much. Its price is so much above<br />
the price of other products in its class that people simply turn away when<br />
it&#8217;s mentioned.  It&#8217;s amazing how many products fall into one or all of these<br />
categories. Fortunately, the same mechanism—redefinition—helps you deal<br />
with all three.  Redefinition is the process of giving a new definition<br />
to your product. It says that the product is this rather than that. Its<br />
objective is to remove a roadblock to your sale—if possible, before the<br />
prospect even knows it exists.  Perhaps the classic case of redefinition<br />
is that of Lifebuov soap in the Thirties. Lifebuoy was a good soap that<br />
did a good cleaning job. But it had one overwhelming drawback—a horrible<br />
medicinal odor.  Since the odor couldn&#8217;t be removed without removing the<br />
cletamng power, the problem became one of redefinition. Put simply: how do<br />
we change this odor from a liability into an asset?  The answer, of course,<br />
was the famous B.O. campaign. The prospect&#8217;s attention was focussed on the<br />
odor of his own bodv— an odor which he was told would drive away people<br />
(and which does).  He was then told this odor must be eradicated—not with<br />
an ordinary soap, which was not powerful enough to do the job but with a<br />
soap with the odor-destroying power to make a longshoreman acceptable at a<br />
society ball. Lifebuov was this superpowerful soap. And the overwhelming<br />
proof—that von could smell the moment you opened the wrapper—was the<br />
strong medicinal odor built into every cake.  This is the simplest, and<br />
often the most effective kind of redefinition. A simple concept-judo. A<br />
complete reversal. Turning a liability into an asset, with a single idea.<br />
Wherever you can use this flip-flop method, do so. But most</p>
<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F I N I T I O N</p>
<p>lOO</p>
<p>problems of redefinition are more complicated, and demand more complicated<br />
means of dealing with them—using many of the devices we have just examined<br />
in the process of Gradualization.  Let us now turn to these devices, and<br />
see how they can present an entirelv different image of the product to the<br />
prospect than vou would have imaginetl, had you not thought them through<br />
beforehand.  1. Simplification Our first category is the overcomplicated<br />
product—the product that sounds too hard. To see how to replace this image<br />
with a more favorable one, let&#8217;s look again at the Television Repair Book<br />
ad that we discussed in the last chapter.  As vou remember, the original ad<br />
for this product failed because it promised &#8220;Do your own TV repairs&#8221; in its<br />
headline. This was considered too difficult by the average set owner (even<br />
though the ad said &#8220;It&#8217;s easy, its simple, it&#8217;s quick&#8221; in the next paragraph).<br />
Therefore—since the ad confronted the prospect with the fact that he<br />
would have to make repairs before it made those repairs easy and simple and<br />
quick—he simply- turned the page and tuned the ad out.  The second ad did<br />
not discuss repairs. It discussed breakdowns and expenses. And, as we have<br />
seen, it spent its first several paragraphs showing that these breakdowns and<br />
expenses did not have to occur at all, if the sets were given the proper care.<br />
Up to this point, the ad has talked about the prospect&#8217;s world—and compared<br />
it with a far more promising world where expert care produces trouble-free TV<br />
viewing. Now the two worlds must be joined through the product.  This joining<br />
is called by the pitchman, &#8220;the turn.&#8221; It is a transition of great delicacy. It<br />
must be accomplished without a jar. In this ad, it begins in this paragraph:<br />
And most important, these experts have discovered that vou do not have to<br />
be a handyman or a mechanic in</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F<br />
I N I T I O N</p>
<p>order to coax this performance out of vour set! Here&#8217;s why. . . .  We have<br />
already seen how the repetition ( . . . these experts have discovered . . . )<br />
and the paragraph parallelism tie this statement into the stream of belief<br />
that has been built up before it.  Now, however, we are going to look at this<br />
same paragraph from another point of view—to see how it provides the first<br />
step in eliminating any fear of making your own repairs.  Notice, of course,<br />
that the very fear of the average owner.  that he is not a repairman, is here<br />
brought out in the o p e n specifically stated—but now framed as a promise.<br />
Notice too that there is no mention of the word, &#8220;repair,&#8221; at this point. It<br />
is still too early at this point. Though the average owner might be willing<br />
to accept the idea that he could &#8220;coax&#8221; better performance out of his set,<br />
it would still be too much to ask him to believe that he could make repairs<br />
on that set at this point.  This leads to the final step. The ad must now<br />
redefine what the reader thinks of when he hears the word &#8220;repairs.&#8221; It<br />
must now lay a new foundation of feet—showing that almost all the repairs<br />
the owner will have to make are actually only minor external adjustments.<br />
It now proceeds to do this, in the following three paragraphs which we have<br />
already studied in the last chapter, and which we will now look at again<br />
to see the second process of p e r s u a s i o n redefinition—which is<br />
also occurring in them.  Here are the paragraphs again: Five Minutes a Week<br />
for Perfect Reception.  These TV experts have discovered that vour TV set<br />
is a great deal like vour body in this respect—that it gives you warning<br />
signals before it has a major breakdown.&#8217; For&#8217;instance, after your set was<br />
installed, &#8217;it probably plaved perfectly for the first week. But then it<br />
began to suffer from the vibration, the jarring, the interference of other<br />
electrical appliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to flop<br />
over or flicker—lines may appear on vour screen.</p>
<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F I N I T I O N</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Now—and this is important—if you had the knowledge to quickly make a<br />
few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of vour set. then vou could<br />
correct those symptoms. you could keep that set playing perfectly, and you<br />
could prevent major breakdowns in exactly die same way thev were prevented<br />
in these manufacturers&#8217; tests.  If you do not have this knowledge . . . if<br />
you do not make these adjustments, then your set will weaken, you will get<br />
a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call a repairman.  Now,<br />
what occurs in these four paragraphs is actually a redefinition of the term,<br />
&#8220;repairs&#8221; in the reader&#8217;s mind. This is done in three separate, but integrated,<br />
wax&#8217;s: 1. By immediately comparing the television set to the human body,<br />
and therefore minor maladjustments in the set to warning signals given off<br />
bv the body before it becomes seriously ill.  By &#8220;making this comparison,<br />
the copy relates the intricate, technical working of a television set to<br />
something as commonplace and familiar as the running nose that warns you<br />
of an approaching cold. Because of this comparison, some of the mystery of<br />
the set is explained away; and the owner gains a new feeling of confidence<br />
in dealing with it himself, as something he understands.  And, at the<br />
same time, this comparison distinguishes between the relatively rare major<br />
breakdowns, and the far more frequent minor maladjustments, which he can now<br />
treat himself as easily as he&#8217;d take a cold tablet to stop his running nose.<br />
2. &#8217;By continuously describing these minor maladjustments as &#8217;warning signals&#8221;<br />
and &#8220;symptoms&#8221; rather than &#8220;breakdowns&#8221; or &#8220;repairs.&#8221; This makes them sound<br />
easily corrected—-before real trouble, which might require technical skill<br />
and complicated tools, can develop out of them.  3. And finally, by stating<br />
outright that these minor adjustments can be corrected by &#8220;making a few minor<br />
adjustments, on the outside controls of your set.&#8221;  Therefore, &#8220;repairs&#8221;<br />
are redefined as &#8220;adjustments.&#8221; Troubles on the TV screen are redefined as<br />
&#8217;warning signals&quot; or &quot;symp-</p>

<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F I N I T I O N</p>
<p>toms.&quot; And &#8220;repair calls&#8221; or &#8220;breakdowns&#8221; are carefully segregated into the<br />
least-likely-to-occur 5% of all possible TV troubles.  Therefore, with this<br />
redefinition in mind—with this reorganization of facts accomplished by the<br />
copy—there is no longer any reason for the average set owner not to make<br />
his oivn minor adjustments, rather than pay a repairman to make them for him.<br />
The objective has been accomplished. The ad can now go on to specifically<br />
state how much monev the owner will save by making these adjustments—and<br />
where he can buv the book that tells him how.  In exactly the same way,<br />
whenever there is a process which is difficult. . . whenever there is a<br />
product which is hard to use, or difficult to apply—the copywriters first<br />
task is to simplify that application in his prospect&#8217;s mind.  This holds<br />
especially true for new inventions which actually simplify processes which<br />
formerly were too difficult for the average prospect. A new breakthrough is<br />
not merely accepted because its manufacturer says so. Its claims for ease<br />
and simplicity must be proved, in the ad, or the reader will simply shrug<br />
his shoulders and say &#8220;it&#8217;s just another copywriter gone wild.&#8221;  Such a<br />
situation is one of the most frustrating experiences you can have. Here is<br />
a product which vou know is far easier to use than anything ever introduced<br />
in this field before—because you&#8217;ve used it! But no matter how loud you<br />
scream <span class="caps">EASY</span> in your ads, people just seem to ignore vou.  What do you do? The<br />
answer is twofold: 1. Redefine (as this chapter shows vou).  2. Mechanize the<br />
new simplicity (as you&#8217;ll see in the next chapter).  Remember, innovation<br />
without acceptance is valueless. The more people know that something is<br />
difficult, and the more revolutionary (and therefore different) your product<br />
is—the more resistance you will meet from them in accepting it.  You must,<br />
therefore, lay a base for acceptance by redefining the entire field for them,<br />
before vou bring in vour product.</p>

<p>lb9</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at one more example of such breakthrough advertising, and see the<br />
solutions the copy offered that made the product a success.  One of the great<br />
ads of all times, of course, is the Sherwin Codv ad. Though most advertising<br />
men are familiar with the ad, they do not realize that the course itself<br />
was a tremendous departure for the times—far easier and simpler than<br />
anything else that had gone before.  But the prospects for such a course<br />
were absolutely convinced that good English was too hard for them. They had<br />
tried to learn it before, and had failed. Therefore, any new course that<br />
could be successfully sold to them would have to redefine English for them<br />
. . . redefine mistakes in English for them . . . and certainly redefine<br />
the process of turning; bad English into good English for them.  The Codv<br />
ad is a masterpiece of Gradualization. It should be memorized—not merely<br />
studied—by every copywriter. However, within it, in four paragraphs, is<br />
contained another masterpiece of breakthrough redefinition—from hard to<br />
easy with a few simple ideas—that goes like this: Onlv 15 Minutes a Day.<br />
Nor is there verv much to learn. In Mr. Cody&#8217;s years of experimenting, he<br />
brought to light some highly astonishing facts about English.  For instance,<br />
statistics show that a list of sixty-nine words (with their repetitions)<br />
make up more than half of all our speech and letter-icritin&lt;i. Obviously,<br />
if we could learn to spell, use and pronounce these words correctly,<br />
we would go far toward eliminating incorrect spelling and pronunciation.<br />
Similarly, Mr. Cody proved that there were no more than one dozen fundamental<br />
principles of punctuation. If we mastered these principles, there would be no<br />
bugbear of punctuation to hamper us in our writing.  Finally he discovered<br />
that twenty-five typical errors in grammar constitute nine-tenths of our<br />
everyday mistakes.  When one has learned how to avoid these twenty-five</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F I N I T I O N</p>
<p>pitfalls, how readily one can obtain the facility of speech which denotes<br />
the person of breeding and education!  When the study of English is made<br />
so simple, it becomes clear that progress can be made in a very short time.<br />
No more than fifteen minutes a dav is required Thus the complicated becomes<br />
simple—the hard becomes easy. This is the first use of Redefinition. Now<br />
let&#8217;s look at the second:</p>
<p>2. Escalation H e r e you are dealing with a product which works, and which<br />
is acknowledged to be easy enough to use—but which simply does not have<br />
an appeal broad enough to assure it of a mass market.  Your job here is to<br />
escalate your product. To give it more importance in your prospect&#8217;s eves.<br />
You do this again by Redefinition. You broaden the horizon of benefits<br />
of the product. You redefine the role that the product pla\ s in the<br />
prospect&#8217;s life. You widen the area of reward that your product yields to<br />
the prospect—showing him that it enters into dozens of vital situations<br />
every day, paving off for him wherehe might least expect it.  For example,<br />
let&#8217;s look at another ad for another English course forty years later. By now<br />
people are not as sensitive to their punctuation or grammar. Now the negative<br />
aspect has lost its appeal; people want good English as a persuasion tool to<br />
win over other people.  So good English must cease to be an end in itself. It<br />
must be redefined, to become instead a means to a more important end—one<br />
which is desired by far more people. And, since the positive aspect must<br />
now be dominant, that part of good English which lias the greatest value<br />
for persuading people—vocabulary— must now be featured.</p>

<p>161</p>
<p>Here is the ad: Revolutionary new Word Power Machine makes you a master of<br />
English overnight.  Automatically gives vou a power-packed vocabulary—<br />
to make your ideas crackle with excitement . . . to hold others spellbound<br />
with the power of vour speech and your written word.  Automatically spots<br />
embarrassing errors in grammar, spelling, pronunciation vou didn&#8217;t even know<br />
you were making. Clears them up at once. Frees vour mind from worrv . . . lets<br />
you feel at ease in am- company . . . gives vou the blazing new self-confidence<br />
vou need to make anybody like you—to win people over irresistiblv to your<br />
point of view. . . .  This approach redefines the benefits of the product,<br />
shifting them from a less desirable area to one that will generate more<br />
sales appeal.  But this use of escalation—to increase benefit appeal—is<br />
only one of the ways it can serve vou. Another is to increase the importance<br />
of the product—showing that something the prospect wants very much hinges<br />
directh upon the performance of your product.  For example, in an ad for<br />
spark plugs, this fact was pointed out to the reader: Yes. You pay $2,000<br />
. . . 83.000 . . . $4,000 for your car.  And a single 99c part robs i/ou<br />
of the real power and enjoyment that car should give you.  Or here, in an<br />
advertisement for a speed math course: If you want to get ahead f a s t<br />
. . . if vou want a position of real importance and responsibility—then<br />
a knowledge of this kind of super-fast, super-accurate mathematics is &#8217;AN<br />
<span class="caps">ABSOLUTE</span> <span class="caps">NECESSITY</span> for your future!  Or escalation can be used to show the<br />
prospect that your product is not something to be put to work just once or<br />
twice a</p>

<p>week—but that it will be needed, and used, by him almost e v e n waking<br />
minute. Here&#8217;s how this was done, in a single sub headline, in an ad for a<br />
course on handling people: Your Entire Life is Spent Trying to Get Others to<br />
Do What You Want—Without Fricti Oil: You must agree with this statement. And<br />
therefore you must redefine the importance to yourself of a technique which<br />
allows you to accomplish the all-pervading task more easily, more effectively<br />
and more rapidly This is the second use of Redefinition—escalation. Now<br />
let&#8217;s look at the third.</p>
<p>3. Price Reduction Here you have the product which, quite simply, costs too<br />
much. Your job is to make that price seem less. You do it by a very simple<br />
act of redefinition, like this: Why does the product cost too much? Because<br />
it&#8217;s being compared icith other products in the same field. And how do you<br />
whittle away, psychologically, at this price? Bij switching the comparison,<br />
and relating it to some other, more expensive standard.  For example, here is<br />
an enormously successful mail order ad for spark plugs, which sold for $1.49<br />
each, or one and a half times the standard for the field, and twice as much<br />
as the discount price. Did the copywriter therefore sav that &#8220;Thev mav cost a<br />
little more, but they&#8217;re worth every cent of it.&#8221; Of course not. He made them<br />
cheap, and he did it in these two paragraphs of psychological redefinition:<br />
Up to now these extraordinary SA <span class="caps">FIRE</span> <span class="caps">INJECTORS</span> were practically made by<br />
hand and would have to sell for as high as $5 each. But we knew that 30 or<br />
40 dollars was more than the average driver could afford—so we decided to<br />
get the price down so low that these injectors would pav for themselves 12<br />
times in one year of driving. So here is</p>
<p>F O U R T H T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: R E D E F I N I T I O N</p>
<p>lb.3</p>
<p>inv astonishing proposition. If you will check your cars performance before<br />
and after you install your SA Fire Injector System and then tell your friends<br />
and neighbors about them, here is what I am prepared to do for <span class="caps">TOIL</span> You can<br />
have a set of SA <span class="caps">FIRE</span> <span class="caps">INJECTORS</span> for the year and model of your ear for only<br />
a fraction of their value. If you act now they are only SI.49 each. . . .<br />
Do you see how he does it? Do you see how many times he does it in these two<br />
short paragraphs? As a last review of redefinition—because its techniques<br />
are so important to you—let&#8217;s just list the individual phrases that<br />
build up. again and again, the feeling of value and bargain.  Here they<br />
are. Did vou catch them all?  &quot;practically made by hand . .  &#8220;would have to<br />
sell for as hi^h as So each . . .&#8221;  &#8220;30 or 40 dollars . . .&#8221; (Notice that<br />
he repeats the hand-made price twice. First he gives it to vou per plug;<br />
and then jor the entire set. Thus the new comparative price is reinforced;<br />
you practically wince at the $40 figure since vou want the plugs by this<br />
time. And you&#8217;re going to feel pretty good when he brings in the now-lower<br />
figure in the next paragraph.)  &#8220;pet the price down so low . . .&#8221; (Here is<br />
the magic word, &#8220;low&#8221;; now legitimatized in your exes by the description of<br />
the hand-made set in the phrases that preceded it.)  &#8220;that these injectors<br />
would pay for themselves 12 times in one year of driving. . .&#8221; (Not only<br />
value, but reward. Not only low-priced, but gas-saving. And again, the<br />
comparison to a higher figure—this time the money you&#8217;ll save on gas.)<br />
&#8220;astonishing proposition . . .&#8221; (Now the price becomes so low that the<br />
mere statement of it may cause you surprise. It may sound slightlv cornv<br />
as we dissect it here, but it is incredibly effective in the context of the<br />
ad. And most of it—perhaps all of it—is never consciously noticed by the<br />
prospect. He simply realizes that he feels that a bargain is being offered<br />
to him.)  &quot;If you will check your car&#8217;s performance. . . and tell your</p>

action you must perform—in order to get the nowlow price. Used before in<br />

works again to substantiate.  with equal power, the feeling of value.)<br />

of discount.)  &#8220;You can have . . .&#8221; (Not, &#8220;You can buy.&#8221; He is letting vou<br />

getting a bargain.)  &#8220;only $1.49 each . . .&#8221; (The classic modifier. The tenth<br />
bargainphrase in these two paragraphs.)  Notice how similar Gradualization<br />
and Redefinition are. Notice how each operates below the surface of the<br />
conscious mind.  Gradualization by its structure—by its arrangement of<br />
facts and phrases. Redefinition by its rearrangement of perspective.  Each is<br />
an extremely subtle and powerful wav of building belief. Each deserves much<br />
more study than we can give it in this book.  Let us now turn to some equally<br />
powerful but more apparent mechanisms that also build belief.</p>

<p>How to Verbally Prove That Your Product Does What You Claim As we have<br />
observed repeatedlv, good advertising copy exists simultaneously in two<br />
different places.  Part of that copy is words on a page. Or sounds carried by<br />
radio waves. Or pictures and sounds coming out of a television set.  But the<br />
other part of that copy—the crucial part—takes place in your prospect&#8217;s<br />
brain. It is the series of reactions—planned reactions and anticipated<br />
reactions—that your copy causes in his mind and his emotions.  Actually,<br />
when your prospect reads your copy, he is engaging in a silent dialogue with<br />
you. You are feeding him ideas and images and emotions, in a planned pattern;<br />
and he is feeding back to you reactions to these ideas and images and emotions.<br />
You hope—you plan—that these reactions will be favorable.  165</p>
<p>Ibb</p>
<p>F I F T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">MECHANIZATION</span></p>
<p>That they will be controlled reactions. That he will see the images you are<br />
projecting. That he will understand and agree with the ideas that you are<br />
advocating. That he will share the emotions you are suggesting he feel, and<br />
even embellish and intensify them.  But also, at the same moment, vou must be<br />
fact that—included among these reactions—are also inevitable anticipations,<br />
or demands, or questions on you must answer these questions or vour copv will</p>
<p>aware of the a number of his part. And fail.</p>
<p>What are these demands he is going to make from time to time on your<br />
copy? Basically they fall into three classes: 1. Demands for more information,<br />
more image, more desire. You have whetted his appetite; now you&#8217;ve got to<br />
satisfy it.  He is saying to vou: &#8220;Tell me more.&#8221;  2. Demands for proof. He<br />
knows he wants it; now he wants to know that it&#8217;s true. He is telling you:<br />
&#8220;Oh veah? Who savs so?&#8221;  3. Demands for a mechanism. He knows he wants the end<br />
result; now he wants to know how you&#8217;re going to give it to him.  He is saying:<br />
&#8220;How does it work?&#8221;  To write good copv, you have to play a dual role. At<br />
the same time, you have to be copywriter and prospect. You have to develop<br />
an almost foolproof sensitivity to these inevitable reactions. You have to<br />
know the exact point that they are going to come in. You have to anticipate<br />
them. You have to switch copv direction, fill in the wanted material, at the<br />
precise point that your prospect loses interest in one theme and demands the<br />
other.  This is one of the most difficult parts of writing copv, and the exact<br />
spot where many good ads break down and lose their prospect. And—since such<br />
anticipation points occur several times in a single ad—you will find yourself<br />
working over the same paragraph of &#8220;unimportant&#8221; copy hour after hour. All<br />
vou know is that at this point something went wrong—at this point vour<br />
prospect is dissatisfied.  We will discuss these problems of copy direction<br />
. . . anticipation points . . . etc. in Chapter 14, on Interweaving. At this</p>

<p>167</p>
<p>point, however, let&#8217;s look more eloselv at the third demand: the demand<br />
for Mechanism.</p>
<p>Verbal Proof This is the vital question: &#8220;Hoiv does it work0&#8221; Your prospect<br />
is asking you here to give him a mechanism. He likes what vou promise—he<br />
wants what vou promise—but he has to be convinced that your product can<br />
aetuallv give it to him.  You have to demonstrate vour product, in words,<br />
logically, so that he can understand exactly H O W it gives him the end result<br />
you promise.  Since the beginning of advertising, of course, the eopv that<br />
furnishes this information—that provides this mechanism—has been called<br />
&#8220;Reason YVhv&#8221; copv. Claude Hopkins was its master.  But there have been<br />
few great selling ads of anv period that do not use it to convince their<br />
prospect that their product actually works.  In fact, the basic question vou<br />
must ask yourself, about this device, when you sit down to write a piece of<br />
copy, is not, &#8220;Should I use it?&#8221; Or &#8220;Should I build a mechanism into this<br />
copv?&#8221; But simply: &#8220;How much?&#8221;  How much mechanism does this copv need? This,<br />
of course, depends—as so many other things in vour cop}&#8217;—on the State of<br />
Awareness of your prospect. Is he familiar with the mechanism by which this<br />
product works? Does he accept it? If so, then this part of your job is done<br />
for vou. Other advertisers have spent their money to make this mechanism<br />
familiar to vour prospect.</p>
<p>Stage One: Name the Mechanism You ma}&#8217; now take advantage of their investment<br />
bv simply naming the mechanism, and going on to beat them with your price<br />
or other features.  For instance, in the conventional camera ad, to back the</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIFTH</span> <span class="caps">TECHNIQUE</span> OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">MECHANIZATION</span></p>
<p>headline claim, all that you&#8217;d have to do is name your mechanisms, like<br />
this: <span class="caps">TAKE</span> <span class="caps">FOOLPROOF</span> <span class="caps">PHOTOS</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">XENOPHON</span> 1750 With Electronic Light<br />
Setter. . . Push-Button Zomar Lens . . . Magazine Load . . . Only $135.<br />
Here, the three mechanisms which insure the perfect pictures are simply<br />
named, and not described at all. The prospect is already familiar with the<br />
way they work from the other ads he has seen, and any further detailing of<br />
their nuts and bolts would simply bore him. Therefore, you name them in as<br />
bold type as possible, and go on to compete with your price.  Most catalog<br />
copy and retail copy needs to assume only this abbreviated form. It deals<br />
with products which are already known, and whose mechanisms are already<br />
understood and accepted.  Therefore, any further wordage on these points<br />
would only be wasted.  But now we come to that vast array of products whose<br />
mechanism cannot simply be named. Why? For two basic reasons: Stage Two:<br />
Describe the Mechanism 1. Because the prospect doesn&#8217;t understand their<br />
mechanism And 2. Because everybody else has the same mechanism, and the same<br />
promise, and the same price. And the market is getting tired, and you need<br />
a new way to compete.  Let&#8217;s look at the simplest case—case #1—first:<br />
Here your mechanism is not so well known, or not known at all, and you can&#8217;t<br />
simply name it. You have to go into more detail; you have to describe it.<br />
So you have the classic situation of Promise—Reason Whv.  You build a<br />
strong, quick promise—and then you follow up with the reason why you can<br />
deliver that promise.</p>
<p>F I F T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">MECHANIZATION</span></p>
<p>169</p>
<p>This one-two punch of promise and reason whv is as old as advertising<br />
itself. Here, for instance, is how Rinso used it in 1926.  First thev give<br />
the promise, like1 this: Who else wants a whiter wash—with no hard work?<br />
How would vou like to see vour wash come out of a simple soaking—whiter than<br />
hours of scrubbing could make it!  Millions of women do it everv week. Thev&#8217;ve<br />
given up washboards for good. ThevYe freed themselves forever from the hard<br />
work and reddened hands of washdav.  Now thev just soak—rinse—and hang<br />
out to drv! In half the time, without a hit ol hard rubbing, the wash is<br />
on the line—whiter titan ever!  Notice how the original promise in the<br />
headline has been taken and intensified in these first thi&#8217;ee paragraphs<br />
of copv. The promise is repeated, in different words and from different<br />
perspectives, over and over again in those first three paragraphs.  But notice<br />
too that—as the copv builds desire—it also builds a growing reaction on<br />
the part of the woman reading it. This reaction can be expressed in one word:<br />
&#8220;Hoic?&#8221; This promise sounds better and better . . . it begins to sound too good<br />
to be true . . .  now she needs reassurance fast.  So the whiteness claims<br />
stop. The copv shifts direction—and now begins to sell the mechanism, like<br />
this: Dirt floats off—stains &lt;jo.  The secret is simplv Rinso—a mild,<br />
granulated soap that gives rich, lasting suds even in the hardest water.<br />
Just soak the clothes in the ereamv Rinso suds— and the dirt and stains<br />
float off. Rinse—and the wash is spotless.  Even the most soiled parts need<br />
onlv a gentle rub between the fingers to make them snowv. Thus clothes last<br />
longer, for there&#8217;s no hard rubbing against a board.  Notice, first of all,<br />
that this mechanism—the suds that float off dirt—is sold just as hard as<br />
the whiteness storv it is brought in to prove. The first rule of mechanism<br />
copv is that it is not</p>

<p>F I F T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">MECHANIZATION</span></p>
<p>scientific discourse. You must never allow it to become dull, or merelv<br />
factual. You must load it with promise, load it with emotion. Every word in<br />
good copy—including mechanism copy— sells. Only in these paragraphs,<br />
the copy is selling a secondary claim (dirt floating off) that proves the<br />
primary claim (a whiter wash). But still—it sells.  Secondly, of course,<br />
you&#8217;ll immediately notice how simple the mechanism is in this 1926 copy,<br />
as compared with the same field today. In those days it was enough to<br />
mention the facts that the suds floated off the dirt; the reader accepted,<br />
as an evident truth, the fact that they would do so.  Today, of course,<br />
in our much more sophisticated and exploited market, she would no longer do<br />
so. Todav vou would need far more mechanism. You would have to explain more,<br />
promise&#8217; deeper, perhaps even invent a miracle ingredient to do the work<br />
for vou.  Stage Three: Feature the Mechanism Which brings us to case #2 and<br />
the difficult problem of what to do when vour market is highly sophisticated<br />
. . . when promises sound alike . . . when price competition becomes suicidal?<br />
This takes us back to Chapter 3, where we discussed marketsophistication<br />
from another perspective. Here we discovered that mechanism—strong<br />
mechanism—saleable mechanism—is not onlv a way to build belief, but may<br />
actually become so important to the success of your product that you must<br />

<p>And hundreds more. Even/ one of them offers i/oti a new way to get what<br />
i/ou&#8217;ve been wanting. A NEW7 <span class="caps">WAY</span>: a new mechanism; a new chance to satisfy<br />
your desire—even if everything else vou&#8217;ve tried has failed vou.  Mechanism,<br />
therefore, can he inside vour ad, to prove vour main claim, or on top of<br />
the ad. elevated bv the state of your market to becoming the main claim.<br />
If people assume that thev know how vour product works.  or if vour claim is<br />
so new that thev don&#8217;t care, then all the mechanism you need can be summed<br />
up in a word or a phrase.  If people are not quite sure how it works,<br />
describe the mechanism—in selling language—until thev have enough<br />
reason-whv to believe vou.  If you have, however, an exceptionally strong<br />
or dramatic mechanism, or if you want to establish definite superiorih&quot; to<br />
other competing products, then sell hell out of that mechanism.  We&#8217;ll see<br />
some expert examples of how to do this in our next chapter, on Concentration-<br />
when we&#8217;re sliown how to compare your product with the rest of vour field.</p>
<p>On the Importance of Mechanism When You Want to Convince Your Reader<br />
That You&#8217;re Giving Him a Bargain One of the sad truths of our time—and<br />
profession—is that our readers do not always beliexe the truth when we tell<br />
it to them. Everv copy writer has had. at one time or another, a perfectly<br />
marvelous product that just couldn&#8217;t be sold—because people wouldn&#8217;t believe<br />
that it could do what he knew it could do.  In the same way manv manufacturers,<br />
and their agencies, are startled when thev cut a price—advertise the<br />
reduction—and see no increase in sales.  What happened? No one believed<br />
them. A price cut—like a product advantage—is only as good as vour words,<br />
and vour strategy, makes it.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>F I F T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">MECHANIZATION</span></p>
<p>Price cuts must be justified. There must be a reason for them. A mechanism<br />
behind them. Without such a mechanism— without such a reason-why you should<br />
give this bargain—you are going to get only a fraction of its real sales<br />
power.  The great master of price-cut mechanization was Robert Collier. His<br />
book—The Robert Collier Letter Book—is one of the great classics of<br />
copvwriting know-how. Here is just one example of how Collier made his<br />
price-cuts, not only believable, but dramatic: Before the Price Goes Up!<br />
Dear Sir: A short time ago one of the old, reliable mills that makes the<br />
finer qualities of woven Madras for shirts began sending out S.O.S. calls.<br />
They had kept their plant going steadily for months, thinking that the usual<br />
demand would easily take care of their excess output.  But, with the weather<br />
so generally unseasonable, the usual demand didn&#8217;t materialize. And there<br />
thev were, heavily overstocked—and needing money.  If we would take all<br />
their surplus stock of the finer grades of woven Madras, amounting to a<br />
quarter of a million yards, they offered to let us have them at wav below<br />
any price we had ever paid for shirtings in all our years in business—at<br />
far less than they could make the materials and sell them for today.  We took<br />
them—the whole quarter-million yards—at a tremendous savings in cost. . . .<br />
A Bargain You May Never Get Again. . . .  Let me point out the difference<br />
between this logical.  carefully-prepared introduction to the price slash,<br />
and a simple.  bare announcement of that slash. Here, the copy writer not<br />
onlv emphasizes bargain over and over again, but brings in qualiti/ as a<br />
counter-desire time after time. He thus uses a mechanism within a mechanism:<br />
(1) the unseasonable weather causing (2 1 the factory to become overstocked<br />
resulting in the primary markdown—to build belief upon belief.</p>

<p>173</p>
<p>Here the copv starts with the mechanism, and onlv goes into the bargain claims<br />
six paragraphs later. Again, he has taken the Creative Gamble: in this case,<br />
that he could hold the reader&#8217;s interest for those six paragraphs. And. because<br />
of this gamble, lie reaps ten times the believabilitv for e v e n word he<br />
said about the bargain-value of his offer from that point on.</p>

<p>How to Destroy Alternate Ways for Your Prospect to Satisfy His Desire As vou<br />
know, in the final analysis, no successful copy ever sells a product. It sells<br />
a way of satisfying a particular desire. And its power to sell ultimately comes<br />
from the intensity of that desire.  If the desire is commercial—that is,<br />
if it is shared by masses of people, and if each of these people want that<br />
satisfaction enough to pay the price required for a mechanism to satisfy<br />
it—then it is highly probable that many firms will try to deliver that<br />
mechanism, or product, to them.  The almost universal condition of commercial<br />
life is competition. No one who sells am&#8217;thing, of course, can avoid it. As<br />
you write, one eye is fixed on your market, and the other on your competitors.<br />
We have described in this book several different ways of</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>beating competition. Let&#8217;s stop for a moment and review them: First, of<br />
course, is superiority of product. This is the ultimate weapon in the war<br />
for the consumers dollar. If you produce the best product, your advertising<br />
has a hundred times the chance of success than if you produce only a fair<br />
product. Most great ads have been associated with great products. Most great<br />
copy claims come from the assembly line. If vours does not. if your copy<br />
is better than your product, then send it to vour client instead of your<br />
prospect, and tell him to make it a reality.  But even the best product<br />
needs equally as effective cop\ to induce people to try it. Otherwise,<br />
the excessive cost of getting the first purchase may drive the product off<br />
the market, before the repeat sales can build up high enough to earn- it<br />
through.  So we come to our second weapon to beat competition—superiority<br />
of promise. A stronger promise, that evokes more desire. A wider promise,<br />
that causes more people to buv. A more believable promise, that brings<br />
in the skeptics as well as the susceptible. This entire book has been<br />
a blueprint for developing such promises.  Third, we have the weapon<br />
of product-role. The role the product allows its consumer to plav. The<br />
personality, the identification, the prestige, the status, the excitement vou<br />
can bring out of your product, or graft onto it.  Fourth, we have response<br />
and reaction as a competitive force—the ability to one-up the competition:<br />
to escalate claims when necessary; to shift mechanisms; to invade new markets.<br />
And fifth—the technique we will discuss in this chapter—is direct attack.<br />
Direct attack—the mechanism of Concentration— differs completely from the<br />
other four methods we have discussed above.  All these techniques have the<br />
common element of ignoring the competition. They concentrate on your storv,<br />
,/our proniises^/o//;benefits, your product. They act as though&#8217;there is<br />
no other winpossible of gaining the satisfaction your prospect desires.<br />
Therefore, they are most effective when vou dominate a</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>177</p>
<p>field, when vour primary problem is to protect your customers&#8217; lovalty against<br />
the claims of your competitor, or when your story is so powerful, so different,<br />
or so fresh that the competition has nothing to match it. In these cases, it&#8217;s<br />
better not to give him the prestige of attack, not to mention his claims or<br />
his product, even invidiously, in the space which costs you such a dear dollar.<br />
But in many other cases—especially where your advertising budget is much less<br />
than his—especially where the bulk of your prospects are already customers of<br />
his—your first problem may be to crack his image, to shatter their loyalty,<br />
before you can rechannel their desire around to vou.  What Concentration Is<br />
But this process of Concentration—this careful, logical, documented process<br />
of proving ineffectual other ways of satisfying vour prospect&#8217;s desire—is<br />
much more than mere attack. If you can only attack another product—without<br />
showing at the same time, by comparison, how your product provides what the<br />
other lacks—then say nothing at all! Never attack a weakness unless you<br />
can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time!  The reason<br />
for this is simple. Your prospect knows that your attack is biased. If,<br />
therefore, you are attacking another product onlv for your own good—in<br />
other words, to win the sale by disparaging your competitor—what you will<br />
probably evoke in his mind is skepticism and dislike, and very little else.<br />
But—and this is the critical point in this process—if you can show your<br />
customer that this attack is for his own good, in his sendee, because your<br />
product will eliminate this weakness, then you have a sales story he will<br />
accept. Then you will make him question even the most ingrained loyalty.<br />
Concentration, therefore, is the process of pointing out weaknesses in the<br />
competition . . . emphasizing their disservice to your prospect . . . and<br />
then proving to him that your product gives him what he wants without them.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>Notice that all the techniques that we have developed in the last few chapters<br />
are used here. Intensification to show the penalties of continuing with the<br />
old product. Gradualization to show the logical cause of the weaknesses and<br />
how thev can now be cured. Mechanization to prove that your product removes<br />
the weakness. And so on.  Concentration is therefore a complicated process,<br />
taking up sizable space to do its job properlv, and combining almost every<br />
trick you have learned in this book. To see how incredibly effective it<br />
can be, however, let us look at two masterful examples.  The first is our<br />
spark plug ad again. As vou remember, in copy, the copy writer has told<br />
his prospect that he can run car without spark plugs, that he can get more<br />
gas mileage more power if he puts &#8220;fire injectors&#8221; into his car instead of<br />
old-fashioned plugs.  Now he goes on to: 1. Provide the mechanisms which<br />
prove his own claim; and 2. To destroy the prospect&#8217;s confidence in plugs<br />
forever, in this brilliant piece of interweaving copy: the his and the</p>
<p><span class="caps">MECHANICS</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">ENGINEERS</span> <span class="caps">READ</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span> <span class="caps">CAREFULLY</span> And for you mechanics and<br />
engineers let me tell vou why fire injection must give vou these results.<br />
A spark plug jumps a spark of electricity across an air gap. This is the<br />
most wasteful and power consuming wav to get electricity from one place to<br />
another and it limits the size of the spark.  Afire injector fires on the<br />
surface of an electrical conductor This is the most efficient wav to get a<br />
big powerful spark into your cylinder.  On ordinary spark plugs the air gap<br />
between the electrode and the firing point is always getting bigger because<br />
the electrode is always burning awav. This means vou have misfiring which<br />
means loss of power plus wasted gas plus raw gas to damage the cylinders<br />
and piston rings. On fire injectors there is no air gap and no electrode to<br />
burn away.  That means maximum gas explosion which means full</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>179</p>
<p>power, full economy and no raw gas to wash away the oil protection from<br />
cylinder walls and pistons.  A spark plug accumulates filth and carbon<br />
because oi inefficient firing. This means vou need regular cleaning,<br />
setting and expensive replacement!  A fire injector never needs cleaning or<br />
setting. It actually- &#8220;breaks in&#8221; and becomes more efficient with use. It will<br />
actually outlast your car, delivering maximum efficiency without servicing or<br />
replacement.  A spark plug gives you a thin skimpy spark that actually blows<br />
out under pressure of less than 120 pounds.  A fire injector gives you a heavy<br />
powerful flame that will not blow out at pressures far heavier than those<br />
created bv even the highest compression engine. . . .  With ordinary spark<br />
plugs you are using, or should he using premium gas which costs from 4 to 8<br />
cents more than ordinary gas, and despite this you&#8217;re getting inefficient,<br />
wasteful gas consumption.  With fire injectors regular gas will give you<br />
up to 8 more gas miles per gallon, up to 31 more horsepower, plus easier<br />
starting in all weather. Add these savings together and see for yourself whv<br />
I sav that fire injectors will pay for themselves every single month that<br />
you drive your car.  Ordinary spark plugs have to he replaced regularly.<br />
In some of the new high-compression cars, a set of plugs will burn up in a<br />
couple of months.  Afire injector installation is guaranteed for the life of<br />
your car without cleaning, servicing, or replacing.  These are some of the<br />
reasons that the U.S. Air Force pays premium prices for surface supported<br />
injectors for their aircraft and why vou will ultimately find fire injectors<br />
in all automobiles. . . .</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s See How He D o e s It I hope that by now you have spotted many of the<br />
techniques he uses to gain his effects . . . to build the overall power of<br />
this sequence. Let&#8217;s just check off a few of them right now: First, of course,<br />
is the interweaving contrast. A weakness in the operation of the spark plug<br />
is pointed out, and then immedi-</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>ately counteracted by the benefit the injector gives you. Bad— good;<br />
bad—good; bad—good: this is the underlying structure of this sequence.<br />
But this is only one use he makes of parallelism. He repeats words to<br />
contrast the inherent weakness of the plug with the inherent strength of the<br />
injector. &quot;A spark plug jumps a spar*.  &quot;Afire injector fires on. . . . &quot;<br />
Spark is a weak word; fire is much stronger visually And he later intensifies<br />
this contrast of image by saying: &quot;A spark plug gives you a thin skimpy spark.<br />
against &quot;A fire injector gives you a heavy, powerful flame &quot; You can picture<br />
the difference.  Throughout the copy, definition and re-definition take place.<br />
Spark firing is the &#8220;most wasteful and power consuming way&#8221; as opposed to<br />
&#8220;the most efficient way to get a big powerful spark.&#8221;  Misfiring means &#8220;loss<br />
of power plus . . . ,&#8221; while maximum gas explosion means full power, full<br />
economy. . . .&quot; (Notice the parallel sentence structure here sharpening the<br />
contrast.)  And, in a beautiful image, the fire injector actuallv &#8220;breaks<br />
in&#8221;—a masterpiece of redefinition by analogy.  Of course, almost every<br />
benefit has its documentary- mechanism. The air gap in ordinary plugs gets<br />
bigger &#8220;because the electrode is burning away.&#8221; The spark plug gets dirtv<br />
&#8220;because of inefficient firing.&#8221; And so on.  Let me point out again the general<br />
structure of this sequence It is: * Bad.  Good.  Bad.  Good.  Bad.  Good.<br />
And so on. It thus offers repeated, direct, one-for-one contrast. It explores<br />
a number of performance factors of vital interest in the prospect—showing<br />
the bad and then the good side of each of them.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>181</p>
<p>A Second Strategy This is one way of accomplishing your Concentration. But,<br />
of course, it is not always feasible, because the points you wish to contrast<br />
mav not be so easily and clearly broken down, one bv one. You may be dealing,<br />
instead, with a time sequence—a recurring, unpleasant experience with which<br />
the prospect is familiar, and which you wish to sharpen before you provide<br />
him with the antidote.  In this case your Concentration copy would adopt a<br />
different structure. Something that looks more like this: What happens to<br />
you now. with the product or products you are using presentlv.  What will<br />
happen when vou switch to the new product.  Here is such a structure, for<br />
an ad selling a reducing pill.  Let&#8217;s look first at the negative copy: For<br />
years doctors have known that ordinary reducing plans—that vou pay S5,<br />
$10 and even 815 for in the stores— are completely passive! That they<br />
depend strictly on your own will power—on vour ability to starve that<br />
fat off your bodv. All that these ordinary reducing plans are able to give&#8217;<br />
vou . . . for vour $5 or 810 or S15—are <span class="caps">HUNGERAPPEASING</span> PRODUCTS—pills,<br />
powders and liquids that do nothing more than swell up in your stomach—that<br />
do nothing more than &#8220;dull&#8221; your hunger a little.  But not one of these<br />
products could do anything to <span class="caps">ACTIVELY</span> help you reduce your weight. To take<br />
the strain off that starvation diet. To actually help vou <span class="caps">BURN</span> UP that uglv<br />
fat. . . <span class="caps">OXIDIZE</span> that fat. . . <span class="caps">MELT</span> IT AWAY— <span class="caps">FOREVER</span>!  So what happened? If<br />
you were overweight, you struggled to do the job of reducing BY <span class="caps">YOURSELF</span>! You<br />
took vour hunger-appeasing pills religiously. You pushed away the foods vou<br />
love. You spent week after week of torture.  And finally, if vou were lucky;<br />
you carved off 5, 10, or even 12 precious pounds.  And then your will power<br />
snapped! You broke your terrible diet. You discovered that your little pills<br />
were use-</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>less to keep you away from the foods vou loved. And the fat flowed<br />
back—heavier and uglier and more deadhj than ever before!  Again, let&#8217;s<br />
glance at the means the writer used to get his b total effect.  In the first<br />
and second paragraphs—Definitions and Redefinition. Ordinary reducing<br />
plans are passive. They depend on vour own will power. They can do nothing<br />
to actively bum up fat.  And in the third paragraph, the equating of taking<br />
ordinarv reducing pills with &#8220;doing the job of reducing yourself.&#8221;  ^ Next,<br />
logic—cause and effect. Given the acceptance of these definitions by the<br />
reader, the third and fourth paragraphs become a logical necessity. This tone<br />
of cause and effect is conveved in the phrase: &#8220;So what happened?&#8221;  Now, of<br />
course, the third and fourth paragraphs condense an experience which is all<br />
too common to everv woman who has ever tried to reduce. She has lived through<br />
this herself, time after time. She recognizes each of the symptoms. And so<br />
she finds herself nodding her head, agreeing with each in its turn, building<br />
up a stream of acceptances which carries more and more conviction as she<br />
finds her own experiences more and more thoroughly described.  And then,<br />
at the climax, in the last line of the fourth paragraph, the destniction of<br />
the old methods of reducing is complete.  Notice the use of the word &#8220;And&#8221;<br />
to tie this final indictment in structurally with the stream of sensory<br />
experiences that have gone before it. There is no doubt that the fat has come<br />
back again in this woman&#8217;s life—if it hadn&#8217;t, she wouldn&#8217;t have read this<br />
much of the ad. But here the inevitable implication buried in a sentence with<br />
which no woman could disagree—is that it icas the failure of the pills that<br />
caused the failure of the diet.  Thus the stage is set for the hero-product<br />
to emerge. It has already been foreshadowed in the second paragraph—in the<br />
negative accusations that these ordinary methods can do nothing &#8220;actively&#8221;<br />
to &#8220;burn awav&#8221; fat.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SIXTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CONCENTRATION</span></p>
<p>183</p>
<p>Now the copv goes on, from failure to promise, like this: And so vou tried<br />
another passive plan. And another.  And another. And then if vou were like<br />
the men and women whose fantastic case histories w ere reported by leading<br />
medical journals—perhaps vou went to vour doctor and asked him for an easy<br />
way out—without torture—and without sliding hack!  These doctors had the<br />
answer in a tiny grey pill—and a common-sense plan.  In their hands—so tinv<br />
that thev could balance it on the tip of their little finger—was perhaps<br />
the greatest weapon ever discovered against deadlv, excess fat. It was a<br />
miraculous compound called LECITHIN—brandnew—whose amazing fat-dissolving<br />
properties had been discovered bv a Nobel prize winner—the co-discoverer<br />
of insulin. . . .  Because this product was perfectly safe—and as easy to<br />
take as an aspirin—main had used it themselves when they wanted to lose<br />
weight. . . .  Thev were not given am starvation diets . . . thev never<br />
experienced a single hungry moment . . . they reported, in case after case,<br />
that thev felt more pep. more energy, more youth and vitality than thev had<br />
known in years!  And then, dav after dav faster and easier and safer than<br />
thev had ever known before, the ugly excess fat around their bodies melted<br />
awav! While thev were eating three delicious meals a dav, thev were shedding<br />
as much as 5 pounds a week. While thev were feasting on mouth-watering<br />
steaks. . . .  And so on. Right back into Intensification copy, with its<br />
strong picture-image sell.  Here are vour contrast—vour mechanization—your<br />
documentation—your reference to authority—and then your return to promise,<br />
in the form of case history, which now has many times its original power,<br />
based on both the elimination of alternate channels of fulfillment, and the<br />
strong supporting mechanism which documents its claims.</p>

<p>One Final Word on Concentration I have purposely chosen extreme examples to<br />
illustrate each mechanism. These copy blocks are longer than Concentration<br />
need logically be. The same effect may be boiled down into two or three<br />
sentences, or even a single phrase, as in this classic headline: &#8220;<span class="caps">SHRINKS</span><br />
<span class="caps">HEMORRHOIDS</span> <span class="caps">WITHOUT</span> <span class="caps">SURGERY</span>.&#8221;  Here is contrast—implied weakness in other<br />
products—compensating promise in vour own.  Again, it is not the content,<br />
nor is it the length of copy used in a mechanism that makes it effective. It<br />
is simply and solelv the problem it solves for you in the development of<br />
your copy— by the emotional reaction it produces on your reader when he<br />
encounters it.  If, in this case, vou have caused him to question a habit . . .<br />
shift a lovalty . . . take a chance on your product—you have done your job,<br />
no matter how few or how many words vou have used to do it.</p>

<p>How to Borrow Conviction for Your Copy We have now discussed five separate<br />
wavs to build believabilitv into vour copv. I do not think we should leave<br />
this subject without at least mentioning one other, entirely different,<br />
approach—that oi borrowing believabilitv from all the places in our society<br />
where it is stored up.  The process bv which vou do this is quite simple. As<br />
vou know, people do not bin&#8217; a newspaper, or a magazine, or anv other medium<br />
of communication for its ads at all. They buv this publication—or thev turn<br />
on their radio and television set—to keep in touch icith the world around<br />
them; to learn what&#8217;s happening, and whv it&#8217;s happening. To be entertained,<br />
or enlightened, or simplv kept up to date.  Now, when a person chooses one<br />
of the publications (and for a moment we&#8217;ll disregard radio and television),<br />
he does so because he believes that that publication is telling him the truth.<br />
He has faith in that publication. He believes in it.  185</p>

<p>And, as long as he has faith in that publication (as any space buyer can<br />
tell you) it remains an excellent medium for advertising—because some<br />
of his trust carries over from the editorial pages to the advertising<br />
pages. He simply assumes that his publication wouldn&#8217;t carry the ad if<br />
it weren&#8217;t true.  And, on the other hand, when he loses faith in that<br />
publication, the effectiveness of its advertising just goes to pieces. If he<br />
no longer believes in the publication, he won&#8217;t believe in the advertising<br />
it carries. This factor—the believability in the medium itself—I think<br />
is a far more important consideration in buying space than mere circulation.<br />
All this is of vital interest to the space buyer, of course, but we have<br />
to go a step further. You see, not only does this reader come to believe in<br />
the publication which he buys repeatedly, but after a while he becomes used<br />
to receiving his tmth couched in the style and format and phraseology of<br />
that particular publication.  In other words, a conditioned reflex has been<br />
formed here.  The man believes in the publication. The publication phrases<br />
its material in a certain way. After a while, that phraseology begins to<br />
carry an aura of truth all by itself no matter what material it embraces.<br />
Thus, you have waiting for your ad—if it is adapted the right way—a<br />
stored believability. A believability reflex. Which you can tap by adopting<br />
this particular publication&#8217;s phraseology when you address its audience.<br />
Let&#8217;s Look at a Few Examples I&#8217;ll try to show you the three different ways you<br />
can borrow this built-up believability: First, of course, and most obvious,<br />
is Format. Each publication has its own look. You have your copy. Your job<br />
is to merge both of them into a combination that will: 1. Allow the reader<br />
to enter into your ad with the least possible mental shifting of gears from<br />
&#8220;editorial&#8221; to &#8220;advertisement.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">SEVENTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CAMOUFLAGE</span></p>
<p>Vr&gt; I</p>
<p>2. Carrv along the greatest possible amount of believability through every<br />
sentence of the ad.  I have not discussed layout in this book, because I<br />
do not believe layout is nearly as effective as copy in determining the<br />
results of your ad. Here, however, layout is important. A single change in<br />
format can add 50% to your readership, and your results.  Your job here,<br />
once again, is to approximate as closely as possible the format of the<br />
medium in which you are advertising.  This means, ideally, letting them<br />
set vour ad . . . using their kind of headline-to-body-copy transition<br />
. . . using their illustrations, their sub heads, their break-up of space.<br />
On the following pages are two ads for the same book on handling people. The<br />
first is an all-purpose, house-set magazine ad that was shotgunned over<br />
twelve or fifteen media. It was mildly successful.  The second is the<br />
same ad. adapted feature for feature for the Wall Street Journal. It was<br />
enormously successful—so much so that it has been repeated i at the time<br />
of this writing) nineteen times, once a month, with no drop-off in pull.<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the changes that give this adapted format such continued<br />
believability: 1. The headline, set by the journal in journal type. There<br />
is no difference between this old-fashioned, upper-and-lower-case headline<br />
and any other headline in the editorial content of this issue. Therefore,<br />
it does not immediately signal the reader: &#8220;This is an ad: beware!&#8221; To have<br />
made it bolder, or more modern, or in all caps, would simply diminish its<br />
effectiveness.  2. The sub headlines—two of them, one following directly on<br />
the other. Verv Nineteenth Century, really. Abandoned years ago by 99% of all<br />
American newspapers. But the Journal uses it, and therefore the ad uses the<br />
same treatment. And the very fact that it is so unusual, and so old-fashioned,<br />
makes its adaptation that much more belief-carrying in this context.</p>

<p><span class="caps">SEVENTH</span> T E C H N I Q U E OF <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CAMOUFL</span> A(.I</p>
<p>3. The two bars One of those small would lose some of sphere (believabilitv,<br />
adaptations.</p>
<p>directly above and below the first sub head touches that defines<br />
individualitv. The ac its atmosphere without them. And atmotrust) is what<br />
you&#8217;re seeking with these</p>
<p>4. The placement of subheads to the extreme left of the column. Another minute<br />
detail. Bad lavout according to the a^encx art director. But again, in perfect<br />
harmony with the format of the editorial content.  5. The line drawing of the<br />
author. An uglv rendering. Far less attractive than the photograph of the same<br />
man in the magazine ad. And yet the Journal does not use photographs of the<br />
men they picture in their editorial columns. And so this ad must do the same,<br />
even at the cost of harrowing screams of pain from its authors (until they see<br />
their rovaltv checks).  Thus, what has been done by these adaptations, is that<br />
a corny, old-fashioned, rather ugly advertisement has been developed for this<br />
specific medium—which has about twice the believability, twice the pulling<br />
power, and twice the staving power of the same exact copy and illustration<br />
presented the massproduced wav.  Is it worth the extra cost? Yes. Should it<br />
be done for each important medium in turn? Yes.  Why? Because in so doing,<br />
you are tapping the ingrained trust that the reader has for each medium in<br />
turn, and channeling at least part of it, unconsciously, onto vour product.<br />
This, then, is the first method of borrowing this built-in believability:<br />
adopting format.</p>
<p>The Second Way to Borrow Believabilitv The second—slighth- less specific—is<br />
adopting phraseology.  This method stems from the fact that certain media,<br />
or classes of media, use certain stereotyped phrases over and over again,<br />
which after a while take on a believabilitv of their own.</p>
<p>S E V E N T H T E C H N I Q U E O F <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CAMOUFLAGE</span></p>
<p>191</p>
<p>In newspapers, to take the most obvious example, there is usually an issue<br />
date, a city of origin, and perhaps a by-line. Each of these news-indicators<br />
may be picked up by the copv writer to add believability to his opening,<br />
as in this extremely successful example: <span class="caps">SKIN</span> <span class="caps">SPECIALIST</span> <span class="caps">DEMONSTRATES</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">HOW</span> TO <span class="caps">RINSE</span> <span class="caps">AWAY</span> <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">BLACKHEADS</span> Bv Claire Hoffman New York, N.Y.—A leading<br />
doctor today showed an audience of men. women and skintroubled teenagers how<br />
to clean oily skin and shrink enlarged pores with a lO-minute home medical<br />
treatment he has perfected. . . .&quot;  And so on. The news tone has been set<br />
by the opening phrases.  The entire remainder of the copy has been given the<br />
atmosphere of a report rather than a sales story by these first few sentences.<br />
The same principle can be used for each of the other classes of media vou<br />
employ. In direct mail, look for the key correspondence your prospect receives<br />
that are opened instantly without exception. Some examples would be refund<br />
checks, government correspondence, dividend notices, confidential reports,<br />
high-priced newsletters, etc.  In radio and TV, adopt the news format and the<br />
news phraseology&#8217;. Even, if possible, adopt the news &quot;sound&quot;—the clipped<br />
phrase of the newscaster, the insider tone of the analyst, the documentary feel<br />
of the news, hand-held camera.  Study the channels of communication that people<br />
believe in.  Adopt their tone, their feel, their style, their sincerity. Make<br />
your ads blend in, so there is no jarring transition. Camouflage them.</p>
<p>Believability-Borrowing Strategy #3 In a later chapter, we&#8217;ll deal with<br />
mood directly. However, as the last method of borrowing believability,<br />
I want to mention</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><span class="caps">SEVENTH</span> T E C H N I Q I E OK BHKAKTIIROl•(;H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: CAMOl IT,A(.l</p>
<p>two mood adaptations that rightly belong j„ this discussion.  We&#8217;ve seen<br />
that you borrow vour publications format and your publications phraseology<br />
or stvle. These two methods ol adding confidence to your copy depend directly<br />
on the particular medium you are using at am particular moment.  You pick up<br />
that publications appearance and idiom, as it were, because people have come<br />
to contrast that editorial manner of presentation with ••advertising<br />
language&quot; in general and because they automatically trust the first, and<br />
automatically approach the second with an ingrained skepticism.  In other<br />
words, advertising language, which is .mite naturalK biased language and<br />
emotionally-charged language, tends to produce a counter-reaction in its<br />
prospects bv its verx appearance.  To overcome this instant and automatic<br />
skepticism—besides borrowing our host publications idiom—we also have two<br />
other idioms which allow us to escape the <del>hard-sell&quot; stereohpe.  The first<br />
is Understatement. Simplicity. A lack&#8217;of color words. Fewer adjectives than<br />
the reader would expect \o superlatives. Short sentences, that fall rather<br />
than rise in tone at their end.  For example, take any Volkswagen ad. Count<br />
the number of nouns per sentence, and compare it to the number of adjectives<br />
See how the ad kids itself—never takes itself too seriously Notice how<br />
it makes its point quietly, and them stops. Even how the extremely short,<br />
extremely simple</del> sentence structure adds to the reeling of sincerity.<br />
Here is a complete Volkswagen ad. which features one superiority of the car<br />
over competitive models. Could ,,ou have told the storv as well, ex-en if<br />
you used ten times as many words?  You never run out of air You also won&#8217;t<br />
have am worries about draining or Hushing the radiator in spring. Then-<br />
is no radiator. &quot; Or hoses.  Or water pump.  Or rust.</p>
<p>S E V E N T H T E C H N I Q U E OE <span class="caps">BREAKTHROUGH</span> <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CAMOUFLAGE</span></p>
<p>193</p>
<p>And so there are no worries about anti-lreeze in the fall or cracked blocks<br />
in the winter.  If vou feel that vou owe vour Volkswagen engine a little<br />
something special every spring and fall, you can do this much.  Just run it<br />
once around the block and let it air itself out.  This is great copv because<br />
of its simplicity and its image and its sell, all of which interact to give<br />
a very powerful argument to anvone looking for a new car.  Also, I&#8217;d suggest<br />
that vou study any of the old Claude Hopkins ads, or John E. Kennedy if&#8217;rom<br />
the old Lord &amp; Thomas days) to get the same power of sincerity without<br />
the limiting whimsy.  Or the great radio and TV pitches of the Fifties.<br />
There is little advertising being written this way, and its very raritv makes<br />
it even more effective. It will not solve every selling problem, but where<br />
it is effective—especialh* in continuous campaigns—it is very effective<br />
indeed.  The second mood vou mav employ to break away from the &#8220;advertising&#8221;<br />
stereorvpe is what 1 call Deadly Sincerity. This is the technique of leaning<br />
over backwards to point out the flaxes in an offer, so that the benefits,<br />
when you bring them in, will be believed that much more deeply.  Since this<br />
is not done in ordinary advertising—since ordinary copv does not knock its<br />
product as well as praise it—it carries great emotional impact, especially<br />
in highly-competitive fields.  Here is an example, for a book on getting<br />
ahead on your job, which had to run after a hundred books on the same subject<br />
had already appeared in the same publication: TO <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MAN</span> <span class="caps">WHO</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> <span class="caps">SETTLE</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span><br />

incredible sacrifices necessary to get there in the shortest possible time.<br />
Here is the most realistic handbook ever written for vou—and vou alone.</p>
<p>LU4</p>
<p>S E V E N T H T E C H N I Q U E OF B R E A K T H R O U G H <span class="caps">COPY</span>: <span class="caps">CAMOUFLAGE</span></p>
<p>This is a private advertisement.  It is not meant for ninety-nine men out of<br />
everv hundred. These men do not have the drive—the impossible pride—the<br />
absolute compulsion to succeed that this advertisement demands . . .<br />
And so on. You can see immediately, in the first few paragraphs of this ad,<br />
how the tone of utter frankness is set. The use of such &#8220;non-advertising<br />
phraseology&#8221; as &#8220;incredible sacrifice&#8221;. . .  &#8220;impassible pride&#8221;. . . &#8220;absolute<br />
compulsion&#8221;. . . &#8220;this advertisement demands&#8221; set the ad off from the others<br />
around it—give it an air of unpredictability that induces the reader to<br />
go on.  In our next chapter when we discuss Reinforcement, we shall see how<br />
this tone of complete fairness, and even criticism, can make a comparatively<br />
minor claim take on immense emotional impact. But for now it is sufficient to<br />
point out that this is one more way to break out of the hard-sell stereotype,<br />
and gain almost the same type of believability that would be given to a<br />
factual report.</p>
<p>14 <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FINAL</span> <span class="caps">TOUCHES</span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now review what we&#8217;ve done up to this point, and the last few problems<br />
that we have to consider.  We started this book with the idea that there<br />
was a definite technique that could produce better headlines than the ones<br />
you were using yesterday. And. since the headline is so vitally important to<br />
the success or failure of vour ads, we devoted the first part of our book to<br />
this creative search.  Then, in the second part, we investigated the equally<br />
important problem of how to exploit that headline. How to lead the prospect<br />
from the feeding of interest and curiosity that your headline had aroused<br />
in him, into a constantly mounting conviction that this product has what he<br />
wants, and that it is absolutely capable of giving it to him.  You use body<br />
copy to accomplish this second objective— perhaps a lot of it, perhaps<br />
very little. In either case, we&#8217;ve examined the three interlocking paths by<br />
which this effective demand is created: first, the intensification of desire;<br />
then the creation of an acceptable product personality- or role with which 195</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>the prospect will want to identify; and then the rather abstract structure<br />
underlying your copy arrangement that produces believability of vour story.<br />
So now we Ye seen how to reach out to your prospects mind on all three<br />
emotional lex-els: Desire . . . Identification . . . and Belieyabilirv.  Now,<br />
as our last problem, we have to put all tliese elements together. We haxe to<br />
take all these promises, these images, these devices, these structures—and<br />
weave them together into one cohesive unit, that holds your prospect&#8217;s<br />
attention from beginning to end.  In other words, having broken down the ad to<br />
analyze the elements that make it work—we now have to deal with the reverse<br />
problem: tying it together once again.  We have several additional devices<br />
that help us do this. We Ye already touched on them in passing in previous<br />
chapters. Now let&#8217;s examine them more closely see what makes them operate.<br />
formalize them into working rules. Like this:</p>
<p>Verification—How to Offer Authorities and Proof Now, of course, comes the<br />
most obvious kind of believability copy. Your proof: your statistics; your<br />
tests; vour testimonials: your authorities; vour trends; vour documentation;<br />
vour seals of approval; your awards won. Any fact at all that vou can use,<br />
anywhere in the copy, to show that your product does what vou saxit does.<br />
The key words here are anyichere in your copy. Because, as I hax-e tried<br />
to shoxv in the last four chapters, the placement of your proof is as<br />
important to its overall effect as the content itself.  I can&#8217;t tell you<br />
anything about gathering proof that xour oxxn research department doesn&#8217;t<br />
knoxv a hundred times better. Or, if you have no research department, that<br />
good hard digging won&#8217;t give you.  There are no special rules to phrasing<br />
proof—except, perhaps,</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>1^&#8217;</p>
<p>to keep it as short as possible, as dramatic as possible, as specific as<br />
possible.  And, above all. remember that proof copy, like every other word in<br />
vour ad, is selling copy. It cannot merely offer proof alone. It must offer<br />
the kind of proof that makes the prospect hungry to read everv word of it. and<br />
it must make him want the product more and more at the end of every line.<br />
Fine. But the next question is: where do you place the proof in your ad? At<br />
what point or points will it be most effective?  And, next, how manv different<br />
proofs or tests or testimonials or what have vou should you include in the<br />
ad? When do you put them in. and when (if ever&#8217; do you leave them out? When<br />
do thev make the ad too heavy? When do they make it dull 0 When do thev make<br />
it too much to be believed?  We have been discussing these questions, though<br />
not in this context, for the last four chapters. For the last four chapters<br />
we have been discussing the placement and structure of claims, of promises. We<br />
have found that the more you prepare for those claims, and the more agreeable<br />
vou have made your reader to accepting them, the more powerful they become.<br />
The same exact rules hold for vour proof. Proof—like claims— is most<br />
effective ichen the reader unconsciously demands it, and when he is reach/<br />
to accept its content as necessary and logical.  This is the rule. As simple<br />
and concrete as this. All the rest is application.  We&#8217;ve gone over, quite<br />
carefullv, the four processes that determine position in vour ad. They are,<br />
once again: 1. Gradualization—the development of a stream of acceptances<br />
from vour reader to vour statements, leading finally to an inevitable demand<br />
on the part of that reader for your product.  2. Redefinition—the removal<br />
of preconceived objections on the part of vour prospect toward your product,<br />
by providing him with a new definition of that product.  3. Mechanization—the<br />
verbal proof that your product works—that it does what vou sav it does.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><span class="caps">THK</span> <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>4. Concentration—the verbal proof that other alternate pre rod nets do not<br />
do this essential function as well.  Now, every one of these processes is<br />
effective, not onlv in increasing the believability of vour claims, but also<br />
in increasing the believabilitv of vour proof.  And, in exactly the same wav,<br />
in everv one of these processes, there is a place for your proof to appear<br />
where it will do twice as much good for your copy as it would aimvhere else.<br />
For example, go back and look at the Concentration copv in the spark plug<br />
ad that we analvzed in Chapter 12. Here was a point-after-point comparison<br />
of the weaknesses of spark plugs contrasted with similar strengths in fire<br />
injectors.  At the end of this sequence, the writer had built up tremendous<br />
believability. He could have done manv things with that believability. He could<br />
have switched it into an immediate restatement of his main claims. He could<br />
have channeled it directly into asking for the order. He could have gone into a<br />
monev back guarantee, etc.  Instead, he chose to pile proof upon believabilitv<br />
in this wav: &#8220;These are some of the reasons that the U.S. Air Force pai/s<br />
premium prices for surface supported injectors for their aircraft . . . .&#8221;<br />
And, in so doing, strengthens the power of both the believability copy that<br />
went before, and the authoritv-reference that now follows.  Thus, and we&#8217;ll<br />
take this up in greater detail in the Reinforcement section that follows,<br />
in copy 1 + 1 can often equal 10.  By adding one powerful piece of copv—at<br />
preeiselv the right moment—to another, you can get an overall effect far<br />
greater than these two pieces of copy would ever produce, if thev were just<br />
spread out all over the page.  Position increases power. We continue to find<br />
new examples ot this ever\- time we explore another copv process.  And how<br />
about the other three processes? How does vour proof interact with them?</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>Well, take Gradualization. Study the TV Repair Manual ad again. Notice<br />
the exact point that the &#8216;&#8220;manufacturers test rooms&#8221; are brought into the<br />
copy—at the very moment that the reader is begging for some sort of solution<br />
to the problems that the copy has intensified over and over again.  Here,<br />
at this point, the reader is searching for an answer.  Here the exact same<br />
proof which might be merely dull statistics if it were presented earlier,<br />
suddenly takes on a sharpened drama— because the reader now is fully aware<br />
of its importance, and is ready to explore every word.  Again, I must repeat<br />
that the main problem with documentation is that it is inherently dull. Your<br />
job, therefore, is to add excitement to it. You have to stage it. You have<br />
to develop a drama, in your readers mind, into which your documentation<br />
enters as the hero. In which statistics suddenly become charged with<br />
emotion—because you&#8217;ve made them the solution to whatever stands between<br />
your reader and the satisfactions that he craves.  I could go on, and give<br />
examples of the interaction of proof and each of the remaining mechanisms,<br />
but I think you would gain far more bv doing it yourself. Instead, let me sum<br />
up by saying this: Documentation is any sort of proof—statistics, facts,<br />
tests, etc.—that your product works.  Mechanization on the other hand<br />
(in case there may be a confusion in your mind) is the verbal and logical<br />
demonstration, and thus also proof, that vour product works. Mechanization<br />
does not necessarily have to incorporate any outside documentation at all to<br />
prove its point—it does this on the strength of its logic and its structure<br />
alone.  Verification—which is different from both of them—is the process<br />
of arranging your documentation within your copy so that it gains the greatest<br />
immediate acceptance from your reader, and has the greatest emotional effect<br />
on him.  Thus, I would suggest that you stop thinking of placing your</p>
<p>z u u</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>documentation only in the headline of vour ad, or in the subhead, or in a<br />
separate box labelled. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Proof.&#8221;  I would suggest instead that you<br />
start thinking of documentation as one more element (along with promises,<br />
belief-words.  momentum-builders, image-sharpeners, emotion-definers, and<br />
all the rest which we&#8217;ll explore before we finish) to be interwoven together,<br />
side by side—so that, combined, thev give vou far greater emotional power<br />
and believabilitv than anv one of them could separately.</p>
<p>Reinforcement—How to Make Two Claims Do the Work of Four The first rule<br />
of all copy, of course, is that it produce an emotional impact. As we have<br />
seen, over and over again, even in believabilitv copy, even in documentation,<br />
every icord must carry image, picture, feeling.  Now. the wonderful thing<br />
about emotional writing, of which copy is one form, is this: That if you<br />
employ it skillfully, then the impact of one emotion, plus the impact of a<br />
second emotion, will often add up—non-mathematically—to the impact of<br />
<span class="caps">FOUR</span> emotions.  In mathematics, one plus one alwavs equals two—never more.<br />
In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten. In other words, two<br />
emotional images, joined together in the right waycan often have <span class="caps">TEN</span> <span class="caps">TIMES</span><br />
the impact that either of these images has hi) itself.  For example, in the<br />
classic Avis campaign, the main theme was &#8220;We try harder.&#8221; Good by itself;<br />
but nowhere near as powerful as it became when it was reinforced by the<br />
reason why Avis tries harder: &#8220;We&#8217;re only second.&#8221;  These two separate ideas:<br />
(1) We&#8217;re second; (2) Therefore.  we try harder.—when they are combined,<br />
take on a joint impact far greater than you could ever logically expect if<br />
vou simply examined each one of them by itself.  In fact, we can even define<br />
one type of creativity as the</p>
<p>T1IK <span class="caps">FINAL</span> <span class="caps">TOVCHKS</span></p>
<p>201</p>
<p>ahiliitj to combine separate images into a new uiiiti/ that is much more<br />
powerful than the mere logical sum of Us parts.  This is how new words are<br />
horn. As well as new phrases.  slogans, concepts, ideas. And. ot course,<br />
headlines.  Your job—and it&#8217;s a tough one is to do just this, image bv<br />
image, throughout the entire !&gt;od\ cop\ ol vonr ad.  For example, in the<br />
ad lor &quot;the man who will settle for nothing less than the presidency ol<br />
his firm&#8217;&#8217; that we quoted in the last chapter, this sequence occurs: This<br />
is John Horn&#8217;s first book, lie is not an accomplished writer, and it has<br />

of the first paragraph, which goes out of its wav to call the reader&#8217;s<br />
attention to flaws in its product, serves as an intensifying contrast to the<br />
positive claims of the second paragraph- <del>making them far more believable<br />
and therefore far more powerful to the reader who is now convinced that he<br />
is receiving a fair report on this book.  It is the juxtaposition ol these<br />
two paragraphs—one following right on top of the other</del>- that makes their<br />
combination so effective.  Copvwriting. in nianv phases, is the search for<br />
such juxtapositions. The last five chapters have been full of examples of<br />
them. I suggest that vou go back and read these examples again, and underline<br />
the combination points—and junctures—where one claim blends into another,<br />
and either sharpens it, pours strength into it. or makes it more believable.<br />
So. one wav vou tie vour ad together is to constantly build one claim on top<br />
of another— -alwavs seeking to make each stronger and more believable bv<br />
the combination.</p>

<p>This same principle applies in a smaller way in our next device.<br />
Interweaving—How to Blend Emotion, Image and Logic Into the Same Sentence<br />
Let me mention at this point a thought that has probably occurred to you<br />
several times over the past few chapters: The big trouble with analysis of<br />
the kind we&#8217;ve been doing in the second part of this book is that after a<br />
while it begins to sound quite mechanical. You&#8217;ve probably thought that I&#8217;m<br />
suggesting that you abandon any kind of creative flow, and work like a sort of<br />
phrase-carpenter. Here you put in a promise; there vou nail on a believability<br />
sentence; then cover both of them with a good strong identification.<br />
This is what it sounds like because it takes so long to identify each one<br />
of these devices and show vou how to work them.  Because of this need for<br />
analysis—which always requires that vou cut individual elements out of the<br />
&#8220;life-flow&#8221; of a growing ad— it sounds like you should actually be conscious<br />
of each device as you are using it to write that ad—even going so far as to<br />
name the device as vou weave it in.  I don&#8217;t think I have to tell you that this<br />
mechanical approach is not my idea, and that it won&#8217;t work. What I&#8217;m trying<br />
to do is exactly the same procedure that a golf pro uses when he wants to<br />
improve your game. He doesn&#8217;t just let you go out and plav.  He stops you,<br />
makes you notice your hands, rationalize your grip.  shift your fingers,<br />
get used to the new feel of the club as you lift it this new way, and then<br />
take a few practice swings—all at the same time that he&#8217;s telling you why<br />
you&#8217;re doing it this way.  When you&#8217;re swinging for the first few times, this<br />
new wav.  you feel pretty awkward, and you&#8217;re conscious of everv muscle in<br />
your arms. That&#8217;s why he has you keep swinging—through one bucket. . . two<br />
buckets . . . ten buckets of balls.  Pretty soon, though, those arm muscles<br />
are going to feel comfortable in that new swing. And you&#8217;re going to lose your</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>conscious awareness of them. At that point, what was mechanical before becomes<br />
intuitive now. But it&#8217;s a new kind of intuition—far more, skillful and<br />
effective than you had before.  This is the kind of intuition I&#8217;m trying<br />
to build in vou. I&#8217;m trying to take you from Creatix itv #1 to Creativity<br />
#2. Both are intuitive states, where you write from the full depths of<br />
vour emotions as well as your mind, and when 1 vou are no more conscious<br />
of the mechanisms and devices that vou are employing to gain your effects,<br />
than you are of the movements of vour fingers on the typewriter kevs.  But,<br />
to get you from State #1 to State #2. 1 have to bring all these details to<br />
consciousness—and make vou awkward in a new and more effective wav than<br />
vou were when vou first learned to write copy—so that you can take these<br />
insights and techniques and bury them inside your own talent—so that vou<br />
can automatically employ them, without thinking about them at all. when vou<br />
want to express most powerfully vour ideas, vour emotions and vour sales<br />
philosophy.  This whole process of &#8220;New Awkwardness leading to NewAbility&#8221;<br />
is seen quite clearly in the very simple technique of Interweaving, which I<br />
learned from a brilliant man bv the name of Walter S. Campbell.  Every copy<br />
writer should read Campbell&#8217;s book, Writing NonFiction (The Writer, Inc.,<br />
1961). In the next chapter I&#8217;ll list other books you should have. But this is<br />
certainly one of the important ones that you can probably master in a weekend.<br />
Campbell is talking about reporting and not copy writing, but the structural<br />
principles are the same. He savs that even in the most factual reporting,<br />
no sentence can be effective if it contains only the facts alone. It must<br />
also contain emotion, evaluation, impact—if those facts are to be given<br />
meaning and importance to the reader.  The same is true for every sentence<br />
you write of copy. That sentence should contain not only promise . . . not<br />
only image not only logic—but as much of all three as possible.</p>

<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FINAL</span> TOl&#8217;CIII&gt;</p>
<p>Weave together your promise, vour logic, vonr emotion, vour image. Pack<br />
vour sentences full of every one of them. Make them blend into each other,<br />
till its almost impossible to pull out the individual threads of the rich<br />
pattern of conviction and desire vou&#8217;re weaving.  For example, go back to<br />
the fire injector ad in Chapter 12.  and see how promise is interwoven<br />
in e v e n sentence of the believabilitv copy where the injectors are<br />
being contrasted with the old-fashioned plugs. In these two sentences,<br />
for instance: &#8220;With ordinary spark plugs you are using, or should he using<br />
premium gas (disadvantage) which costs from 4 to 8 cents more than ordinary<br />
gas (disadvantage), and despite this (disadvantage you&#8217;re getting inefficient<br />
(disadvantage), wasteful (disadvantage 1 gas consumption (disadvantage).&#8221;<br />
Ill this first sentence, which is part of a logical sequence offered as<br />
proof of superiority through comparison of performance characteristics,<br />
the copv writer has managed to insert six disadvantage-images for the reader<br />
to remember the next time he considers buying ordinary plugs.  Now the copv<br />
writer goes on to his contrasting sentence about the injectors: &#8220;Willi fire<br />
injectors regular gas (promise) will give i/ou up to 8 miles more per gallon<br />
(promise), up to 31 more horsepower (promise), plus easier starting (promise)<br />
in all weather (promise).&#8221;  Five promises in this second sentence. The<br />
packing in of image upon image to build an overwhelming effect.  Or, as an<br />
even more complicated example, involving the interweaving of almost everv<br />
copv element in the book, let&#8217;s look at this sentence: &quot;And, most important,<br />
(a mood-builder, indicating the value to the reader of the promises which are<br />
about to follow) these experts (reference to authority to build believabilitv)<br />
liave discovered (more believabilitv through the use of the scientific idiom)<br />
that i/ou do not have to he a handyman (the core-promise 1</p>

<p>or « mcc/wmr (restatement of the core-promise) in order to coax (promise<br />
of ease) this performance (promise, condensing all the claims of superior<br />
reception that have already been detailed in the previous copy) out of i/our<br />
set.&quot;  Now, is this done consciously 1 /Not at all. But the copy writer<br />
knew the principle of i n t e r n e t in-r . . . |1U(I experimented with<br />
it before . . . and had it stored axvax in Ins unconscious as one more tool<br />
to be used—intuitiyely-to urain the effect he wanted, at the exact moment<br />
he needed it.  Try it yourself. See how mam different emotions you can pack<br />
into a single sentence . . . paragraph . . . sequence. See how much richer<br />

<p>S e n s i t i v i t y &#8211; H o w to Give Your Reader What He D e m a n d s Step<br />
In Step Throughout the Copy Now; if you continue to pile promise upon promise,<br />
identification upon identification, documentation upon documentation element<br />
upon element, where do you stop, Where does it become too much? Where does<br />
the reader become satiated or bored and want to go on to a new image or new<br />
promise, or even the close?  At what point are you starting to oversell? How do<br />
uou catch yourself, and switch off?  We have already touched on this problem<br />
before in Chapter 11. I suggest that vou reread that discussion now. even<br />
though we re going to expand on it at this point.  Here you are reiving on<br />
your own powers of empathy You must be, at the same time, not only the writer<br />
of your ad but its reader. You must anticipate that point in the copy flow&#8212;<br />
as it is transformed into a series of impressions in your readers m i n d<br />
where he is going to sax-: &#8220;I&#8217;ve read enough about this. Give me this instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> <span class="caps">TOUCHED</span></p>
<p>And then vou must shift the direction of the copv to meet his new direction<br />
of interest.  In other words, what we are talking about now is the overall<br />
structure of your ad. Not a sentence, or a paragraph, or a sequence: but<br />
the architecture of the ad as a ichole.  Every ad has an architecture,<br />
as I&#8217;m sure <span class="caps">YOU</span> know. This is the over-all pattern of the ad, including<br />
when and where and how mam- times you shift from one t \ p e of copy to<br />
another. It is the ability to recognize these shift points, and to change<br />
when <span class="caps">YOU</span> encounter them from—sa\-—promise copy to mechanism copy to<br />
documentation copy to promise copy again, that makes vour ad stick together,<br />
or fall apart.  This is an almost impossible skill to communicate, since it<br />
relies so much on the feel of each individual situation. However.  I can show<br />
it to <span class="caps">YOU</span> after it&#8217;s occurred, in a series of four ads on the same general<br />
type of product—books—and how each differs from the others in the way<br />
large blocks of copy elements are blended in and out of the oyer-all sell.<br />
As IYe said before, I use mail order as m\ example because mail order is<br />
the longest general form of copy, because it usually sells the hardest, and<br />
because the techniques I&#8217;m talking about are usually outlined most clearly in<br />
this type of copy.  Let&#8217;s look at our four ads, and see how each approaches<br />
the basic task of selling a similar product in a different way and with a<br />
different blend of elements:</p>
<p>Sample Ad #1 This is the friend-winning ad we looked at in our last<br />
chapter. IYe indicated each major block of copy, in sequence, by a letter<br />
of the alphabet; and each of the shift points b\- a number.  I am using<br />
as examples all direct-promise headlines. The promise in this headline is<br />
almost universal (A): that vou can make anybody like <span class="caps">YOU</span>. (See page 208.)<br />
Instead of intensifying the promise immediately, however, as</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>many other ads in this category have done, this copv starts out by restating<br />
the original headline promise (making anybody like you becomes popularity)<br />
and by defining the previously unrecognized fact that this popularity can<br />
be taught. (B).  Why was this done? For two reasons: (1) because this novel,<br />
almost paradoxical redefinition iCan popularity be purchased?)  established<br />
an immediate point of difference between this book and the dozens of similar<br />
titles that had come before it always a critical problem. And (2&gt; because this<br />
ad&#8217;s subject was a teacher, and the ad&#8217;s whole believabilitv rested upon the<br />
fact that so many large and respected corporations had paid this man so much<br />
money to reach these techniques to their employees.  This is established by<br />
the ads first shift point and first transitional sentence (1). This has hern<br />
proved by . , . leads directlv into the first documentation block (.&#8217;•. in<br />
which the corporations are named.  Thus we have the developing pattern of the<br />
ad as: Promise Definition Documentation . . .  Right up to the next transition<br />
sentence (2), which brings in the first detailed promise block iD). and which<br />
then echoes again the documentation (E) and price comparison.  Now, after<br />
a brief transitional promise (F), the ad defines again the importance of the<br />
over-all promise (G), backs it up with a third restatement of the documentation<br />
(H), and then states directly the price comparison and monev-back guarantee<br />
(I).  Then, with the classic transition (3), it goes on to devote the rest of<br />
the ad to a detailed cataloguing of the promise (f). A recitation of promises<br />
that are far stronger now—because of the preparation of definition and<br />
documentation that has been laid for them, than they would have ever been<br />
had thev simply been put at the beginning of the ad without such preparation.</p>

<p>Incidentalh&#8217;, notice how the negative promises (K), and the full list<br />
of documentation (L), have been placed out of the main stream of the ad<br />
where they can be read, or not read, by those that are interested in them.<br />
Sample Ad #2 An ad for a book on improving the power of vour mind.  Again the<br />
promise-headline (A), intensified by—this time—an elaboration of this<br />
promise (B). (See page 212.)  Now, using its first transitional sentence<br />
(1), the ad moves into two paragraphs of negative &#169; and positive (D)<br />
redefinition.  And then, with a single transition-word {Simph/—2), again<br />
elaborates the promise, making it stronger and stronger and more and more<br />
detailed, and at the same time giving it the believabilitvtone of definition.<br />
This definition-tone is unchanged throughout (F), where promise is again<br />
interwoven with fact, leading immediately into a transition (3) in which the<br />
tone is that of proof, but the content is straight promise (G).  Then this<br />
proof is connected (4) with the entire promise catalog (H) which fills the<br />
rest of the ad.  This ad—enormously successful—is one of the best examples<br />
of interweaving we have. There is so subtle a blending here of definition,<br />
documentation and promise, that everv word of the copy soon takes on the aura<br />
of pure fact.  Sample Ad #3 Now we move on to the straight-promise ad. This<br />
is the rock-em, sock-em type, dominated by promise and mechanismpromise,<br />
which gains its power from the sheer momentum and relentlessness of its<br />
claims. (See page 216.)  It again starts with the over-all promise (A),<br />
which it immediately follows up with a second, elaborating promise (B).</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>Then it moves directly into its fundamental definition &#169;, which it<br />
equates in a&#8217; single phrase (then t/oti could—I) with a greatly detailed<br />
promise (D), and then follows up with a beautifully condensed paragraph<br />
which consists of a transition in (2) to a restatement of its fundamental<br />
redefinition (E). and out again (3) to the remainder of the ad. (F&gt;. which<br />
is sheer promise and promise-mechanism from then on.  Here, documentation<br />
is disregarded entirely. The full weight of the sale depends on the power<br />
and momentum of the promisetrain.</p>
<p>Sample Ad #4 And finally, we have a beauty book. Here, the main promiseheadline<br />
(B) is preceded by the critical authority-reference (A) which: first, sets it<br />
apart from the other similar products it must erase from the prospects mind:<br />
and second, brings in immediately the key persuader of its author. (See<br />
page 220.)  &#169; block, while promise copy, also serves the simultaneous<br />
purpose of being a momentum-builder—a technique we will discuss in a moment.<br />
Using the different type faces and sizes as transitional elements, the copy<br />
then introduces its crucial concentration copy (D), in which it redefines<br />
what the woman can now expect from her appearance, and in which it outdates<br />
other approaches to giving this fulfillment to her.  After</p>
<p>block.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Because&#8230; comes</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>first</p>
<p>promise-elaboration</p>
<p>But there is no piling up of claim upon claim here. There is too much ingrained<br />
skepticism in this prospect—too much awareness of other, previous claims<br />
that have disappointed her in the past. This skepticism must be anticipated,<br />
and answered. This is done, first (F) by agreeing with it, and then (G)<br />
bv shifting the entire story onto the doctor for twelve paragraphs—bv far<br />
the longest reference to authority of any of our four sample ads.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>Then a transition (2) back to promise (H), which fills out the rest of the ad.</p>
<p>See How the Structure Differs Let me say this. Although I have not<br />
pointed out everv transition, nor everv blending of different tvpes of<br />
copv, I have, 1 hope, given you enough material to see clearlv how ads<br />
differ in overall structure, as they differ in content, as the demands of<br />
their material differ.  They range from the simplest promise-elaboration<br />
(example 3), to the most subtle blending of all the various elements of<br />
desire, image, proof, definition and what have vou (example 2), to the<br />
most complicated promise-and-proof. . . promise-and-proof reinforcement<br />
(example 4).  Each problem demands a different structure. Each signals.<br />
as you write it, that here—at this precise point—your copy has left<br />
your reader. You have gone on straight when lie wants to turn left. You are<br />
piling on promise after promise, when lie no longer believes you. You are<br />
burving him under a sea of statistics, when he is convinced you are telling<br />
the truth, and wants you to make those delicious promises all over again.<br />
This is what you feel when you are writing the ad. Probablv a kind of<br />
irritating confusion. A blockage. A sense that the copv has suddenly<br />
gone dead, and all you are writing now is words.  So you stop, and think,<br />
and look for a new direction. I hope.  in this section, that I have given<br />
you a faint indication of what some of these directions might be.  What,<br />
on the other hand, can vou learn from analvzing the structure of your ads<br />
(or other writers&#8217;) after vou have finished them?  Primarily—what kind<br />
of ad you have written. Is it straight promise? Too much documentation? Too<br />
little definition of the new world of possibilities vour product has created?<br />
Does it still sound too much like evervone else&#8217;s copv. Or</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>product? Could you put another brand-name on it, and not make any difference?<br />
Have you left anything out? Will this bare promise earrv the sale? Or could<br />
you increase its impact bv paving its wav with some mechanism or believabilitv<br />
copv? How about a proof section? A use photo? A fuller description of the<br />
wav it works?  Mind you, this is not content alone that ice are discussing.<br />
If you take the same content, and give it a new structure, you are going to<br />
create a new ad. Trv it. See for yourself. If vou&#8217;re stuck sometime, throw<br />
awav vour headline, throw awav vour rough copy flow, and start off again <span class="caps">ISO</span><br />
degrees away from where you started before.  I want to repeat this again:<br />
A new structure is a new ad. It brings out new ideas. Gives vour promises<br />
new sharpness, new flavor, new believabilitv and even begins to create<br />
whole new sections that you never dreamed were there in the product before.<br />
So we&#8217;ve come full circle. You start vour ad bv creating your headline. You<br />
develop your copv storv from that headline. But if the copv story doesn&#8217;t<br />
develop—if vou gradually find that the headline isn&#8217;t really that good<br />
after all—then perhaps the very elements that are begging to come out<br />
of your 6-point type should be at the top of your ad.  This is what makes<br />
this copv writing so interesting. You&#8217;re always being surprised—with ideas<br />
from the most ungodly places.  Just make sure you&#8217;ve got vour eves open wide<br />
enough to catch all of them.  Momentum—How to Draw Your Reader Deeper and<br />
Deeper Into Your Copy There are two other devices we should discuss. Both of<br />
them help tie your ad together, though that&#8217;s not their primary function.<br />
The first is Momentum. How to draw your reader into vour copy . . . keep<br />
him reading . . . making sure he doesn&#8217;t quit vou in the middle.</p>

<p>Copy&#8217;s first job, of course, is to be read. If its not read, it can&#8217;t sell. And<br />
if you take some time to make your points—to intensify your desire, to build<br />
and rebuild vour believability, to reinforce one claim with another—then<br />
you&#8217;d better make darn sure that you&#8217;ve put plentv of momentum-builders into<br />
vour copv There are two types: 1. Actual momentum phrases; and 2. Incomplete<br />
statements, or teasers, that draw the reader further into the copy in order<br />
to complete them.  The first type, the momentum-phrases, are time-honored.<br />
They are used in almost any sort of persuasive or educational writing. You<br />
insert them in your copy primarily in your transitionsentences, to keep<br />
interest from flagging, to indicate to vour reader the general type of<br />
material that&#8217;s going to follow. They are &#8220;addy,&#8221; but they work. Here are a<br />
few examples, taken from the four book ads we looked at in the last section:<br />
&#8220;They paid up to $22.50 a person to learn priceless techniques like these:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You can learn them all, in your own home next weekend, without risking a<br />
penny. Here&#8217;s how&#8221; &#8220;Here is the information you will find in this hook.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Let me explain.&#8221;  &#8220;All I ask from you is this.&#8221;  &#8220;What you are going to do,<br />
in the very first hour that you receive the book, is this.&#8221;  &#8220;And yet it&#8217;s<br />
only the beginning.&#8221;  &#8220;<span class="caps">THEN</span> put this simple trick to work for uou—that<br />

<p>219</p>
<p>And so on. These are actual invitations to read on. H <span class="caps">YOU</span> write long copv, thev<br />
should be spotted throughout it.  The second category of momentum-builder is<br />
much more subtle, and giyes <span class="caps">YOU</span> thousands of waYs to keep drawing vour reader<br />
along after vour developing thought. It&#8217;s based on the simple principle that<br />
if <span class="caps">YOU</span> make a statement that interests vour reader, and if vou purposelv<br />
and skillinllv do not complete that statement, so that there is a question<br />
of how it can be done, then he will read on to find out more.  In other<br />
words, <span class="caps">YOU</span> are continuallv throughout the copv: 1. Creating interest in<br />
a specific point; 2. Raising a question in his mind about that point; and<br />
3. Implying an answer to that question later in the copv.  Here are some<br />
examples of this technique: &#8220;And <span class="caps">YOU</span> will do it often using nothing more<br />

&#8220;Just picture the scene as these college horticulturists began this amazing<br />
flowering test of roses. For here gathered in a test field were all the<br />
highly-prized queens of rosedom . . . rose blends that today sell for as high<br />
as 83.75 for a single plant. Row upon row of roses . . . prize-winners in<br />
international competition . . . the best the world has to offer . . . <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">THEN</span>,<br />
<span class="caps">NEARLY</span>-<span class="caps">WILD</span> <span class="caps">STARTED</span> TO <span class="caps">BLOOM</span>!&#8221;  And so on. The objective here is to keep lite<br />
reader going— for one more sentence, one more paragraph, one more sequence.<br />
Notice, of course, that every one of these examples not only produces momentum,<br />
not only raises questions in the reader&#8217;s mind that he virtually must read on<br />
to answer—but is also, at exactly the same time, loaded with sell. Again,<br />
interweaving—making each element in the ad accomplish two objectives. No<br />
waste words.</p>
<p>M o o d — H o w to Pack Your Copy With Drama, Excitement, Sincerity or Any<br />
Other Emotion You Wish Now we come to the matter of words—and the color<br />
which words create.  I have given you dozens of different examples in this<br />
book of selling copy. All these examples had certain elements in common—they<br />
were strong, successful, convincing and so on. But, at the same time, each<br />
of these copy blocks differed from the others in one immediately apparent<br />
way—in the mood that each set, simply by the rhythm and words that the<br />
copy writer used to express his thoughts.  Words and rhythms. They are to<br />
the copy writer what line</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>and color are to the painter. They set the mood of your story— carry the<br />
emotion so subtly that vour reader never really realizes where the excitement<br />
or the image or the conviction is actually coming from.  For example, here<br />
are several of the passages we&#8217;ve looked at before. Now let&#8217;s italicize the<br />
mood-builders within them, that make each so different from the others:<br />
Objective: to emphasize color, beauty, excitement, visual image: And<br />
when that third precious ingredient reaches those buds—then that very<br />
morning vou will open the door to vour house—AND <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> BE <span class="caps">BLINDED</span> BY<br />
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">EXPLOSION</span> OF <span class="caps">COLOR</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> <span class="caps">GREETS</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> IN <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">GARDEN</span>! . . . You will see<br />
rose bushes weighted down bymasses of blossoms, of a richness and perfume and<br />
color you have never imagined before! You will walk past solid, blazing rows<br />
of chrysanthemums so thick that you can&#8217;t even see a leaf in between. . . .<br />
Notice that you don&#8217;t even distinguish many of the separate images until they<br />
are called to vour attention. Notice also that some of the words are primarily<br />
visual image-sharpeners (weighted down . . . solid, blazing rows . . . so<br />
thick you can&#8217;t even see a leaf in between). While others convey, not image,<br />
but emotion (precious . . . that very morning . . . blinded . . . greets<br />
. . . you never imagined before).  These words are emotion-definers. They<br />
tell the reader what to feel about the images and ideas you are presenting<br />
to him.  Their very essence is that they are so subtle that he does not see<br />
them . . . that thev do not call attention to themselves, but simply flavor<br />
and evaluate the images your copy is forming in his mind.  Certain classes of<br />
readers will notice these emotion definers.  When they do, your copy becomes<br />
either questionable or corny to them, and vou have lost them. Therefore,<br />
vou have to know always whom you are writing for. What their level of<br />
sophistication is—in tone as well as product-awareness. And vou may have to</p>
<p>^Z4</p>
<p>T H E <span class="caps">FINAL</span> T O U C H E S</p>
<p>change your tone when you take the same ad from one class of media to<br />
another—down as well as up.  Of course, when everybody sees vour emotion<br />
words, then you&#8217;ve got a bad ad, and you&#8217;d better rewrite, fast.  And don&#8217;t<br />
forget the rhythms. Read the ad out loud. See how you can almost scan it,<br />
as though it were close to blankverse. This richness of rhythm parallels<br />
the richness of image— helps build the excitement and sensuousness<br />
of the mood.  Now let&#8217;s look at another piece of pounding copv, and see<br />
how words and rhvthms add to the power and momentum that are put behind<br />
its staccato stream of claims: &quot;This letter says that if you could onlv<br />
liberate the exact same talent and intelligence and abilitv that vou have<br />
tied up inside you today—then you could: &quot;read anything you wish, twice<br />
as fast as vou can read it t o d a y . . . &quot; &quot;absorb facts like a sponge,<br />
and repeat them almost word for word years later . . .  &quot;flash through<br />
math, business, financial problems that have you stopped cold todav. . .<br />
&#8220;hold people spellbound with the power of vour speech and your written word<br />
. . .  &#8220;out-think others when you have to. tower over them in judgement,<br />
outshine them completely in imagination . . .&#8221;  Here again, there are two<br />
types of emotion-definers. The power words (liberate . . . hold spellbound<br />
. . . out-think . . . tower over . . . outshine completely), which build a<br />
subconscious current of potency that permeates each individual claim as it<br />
occurs in the copy. And the frankness, man-to-man, lets-let-our-hair-down<br />
tone-builders (this letter says . . . tied up inside vou . . . like a sponge<br />
. . . stopped cold) that say silently that there&#8217;s no nonsense here, no<br />
high-faluting phrases—just common-sense which can be absorbed bv anvone.<br />
And, of course, the machine-gun rhvthm. Short, choppy sentences. Verb<br />
. . . verb . . . verb. Claim . . . claim . . . claim. Pro-</p>

<p>225</p>
<p>pelling the reader through the copy. Piling promise upon promise, image upon<br />
image in an attempt to overwhelm him.  Notice especially the vast difference<br />
between these two highly-successful pieces of copy. Their vocabulary, the type<br />
of emotions they strive to arouse, the images they use, the models of speech<br />
they borrow, the length of sentence and paragraph, the ratio of adjectives to<br />
nouns and verbs, etc.  We could go on, of course. Go back to the Volkswagen<br />
copy, and see how the emotional tone of sincerity is conveyed by the absence<br />
of adjectives, in all the places you&#8217;d ordinarily expect to find them. As<br />
well as whimsey. a continuous self-kidding, which builds, first, a sort of<br />
corporate affection, and then trust.  Try the fire injector ad again. Notice<br />
how the long, rather clumsv sentences give a feeling of ingenuousness and<br />
reason to the copy Try to read them out loud. You can&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t scan;<br />
they have no definable rlrythm: they don&#8217;t look like a &#8220;copy writer&#8221; wrote<br />
them at all. And, of course, there is the same straightfrom-the-shoulder<br />
phraseology, to reinforce this feeling of honest appraisal.  All this,<br />
I repeat, is done unconsciously. You do not see it unless vou look for<br />
it. And sometimes you have to dig very deep indeed to get every piece of it.<br />
Mood-building is deliberate on the part of the copywriter— unnoticed on the<br />
part of his reader. As with so much of the rest of the ad, it lies underneath<br />
the surface, to do its work imperceptibly.</p>

<p>I have now given you what I&#8217;ve learned about writing copy. It has taken many<br />
years to learn it— three more to set it down to my own satisfaction. I<br />
hope it will help vou in the onlv way that really counts: to do a better<br />
job and make a little more money.  There are, of course, manv many men in<br />
this industry who know far more about these techniques, and who can produce<br />
far better copy than I. Mv excuse for writing this book is that they don&#8217;t<br />
seem to have included—at least to my present knowledge— manv of the<br />
specific techniques which I&#8217;ve discussed with you here.  Some of them&#8217; have<br />
written books on the subject—great books—and I&#8217;d like to list them here<br />
for you. I think you should buy and read, every one of them, and then thumb<br />
through them again everv year or so, just to catch what you may have forgotten.<br />
Here they are: Indispensable, of course, is Julian Watkins&#8217; great anthology:<br />
The 100 Greatest Advertisements, Moore Publishing, 1949.  227</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>E P I L O G U E —A <span class="caps">COPY</span> W R I T E R S <span class="caps">LIBRARY</span></p>
<p>Claude Hopkins wrote a great book, My Life in Advertising, Harper,<br />
1927. Make them dig it up for you. And see if vou can&#8217;t get some of the<br />
old Hopkins ads.  John E. Kennedy (not F.) wrote a little pamphlet manv<br />
years ago called Intensive Advertising, which has just been republished<br />
by Printer&#8217;s Ink. Get it. It&#8217;ll be the most profitable evening&#8217;s reading<br />
you&#8217;ve ever done.  J. K. Lasker, who worked with both these great writers,<br />
never wrote anything himself. But he did give a series of talks before his<br />
staff one week, and Printers Ink has again captured them.  They&#8217;re called The<br />
Lasker Story.  Robert Collier&#8217;s Letter Book is published bv Prentice-Hall.<br />
It&#8217;s a gold mine.  David Ogilw wrote Confessions of an Advertising Man,<br />
which you can buv as a paperback. Charming and wonderfully profitable.<br />
Rosser Reeves&#8217; very short book, Reality in Advertising, is published by Knopf,<br />
and must be read several times before vou get everything out of it vou should.<br />
Milton Biow&#8217;s book, Butting In, is marvelous in the first half, repetitive<br />
in the second.  And don&#8217;t forget Campbell&#8217;s book, Writing Non-Fiction. Or<br />
those by Caples. Young, Glim and Bedell. Or the motivation research books<br />
bv Dichter and Martineau. Or the great book on layout, Visual Persuasion,<br />
bv Baker.  Then there are the books on American society&#8217; todav—bv Mills,<br />
Riesman, Fromm, Kardiner and all the rest. And the articles on the emerging<br />
trends in the media. And the media themselves. And of course—your primarv<br />
source—the ads themselves.  Keep reading. Keep analvzing. Keep writing. Keep<br />
looking for the new idea—the million dollars hidden somewhere in that<br />
typewriter of yours. Always shoot for the moon—it&#8217;s one of the few real<br />
thrills left today!</p>
