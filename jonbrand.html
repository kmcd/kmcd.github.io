<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>Paul: Hi, everyone. I’m Paul Hontz from The Startup Foundry. Joining me today<br />
is Jonathan Kay from the Grasshopper Group. Thanks for being here, Jonathan.</p>
<p>second, Ring Central. At the end of the day, if you compare Ring Central<br />
to Grasshopper, the offerings, the pricing, it’s all about the same<br />
thing, man. There’s not a huge differentiator. So, it’s the intangible<br />
Jonathan: Absolutely my pleasure, things. It’s their perception. It’s<br />
the man. Anything for you and Noah.  fact that they’ve probably had a<br />
beer with me, maybe they’ve had Paul: All right. In this AppSumo a beer<br />
with our founder, David action video, we’re going to learn Hauser, and<br />
you’ve never even met why brand perception sells. Jona- anyone from Ring<br />
Central. That’s than, what is brand perception in the perception. That’s<br />
what makes the first place? Like, why should we someone feel comfortable<br />
taking care about this?  their wallet out of their pocket.  Jonathan: Yeah,<br />
it’s funny. Brand perception is what people think when they go to your<br />
“about”’ page, right? It’s what your brand is outside of just what<br />
you sell. So, it’s funny. I work at a company called Grasshopper. We sell<br />
a virtual phone system. That’s boring, right?  A virtual phone system is<br />
not an exciting product. It’s not interesting. It’s not sexy. It’s<br />
not anything like that, right? So, let’s just take our core competitor,<br />
Paul, for a www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>Paul: Okay. So, we’re going to learn some steps that you guys have<br />
actually implemented and how to convert that into the paying customers,<br />
right?  Jonathan: Let’s hope so. Yeah.  Paul: Okay. Now, can you give us<br />
the specific example of what Grasshopper has been able to do?  Jonathan:<br />
Yeah. I think we’re going 2</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>to go through a lot of examples throughout this video, but just to touch on<br />
the surface, man, you know what, at some point we actually sent newsletters<br />
to our customers, and I’m not embarrassed to say that. We paid someone to<br />
spam our paying customers with newsletters. We learned that wasn’t the<br />
right way. That’s not how we wanted our customers to perceive us. So we<br />
started to do things that our customers could relate with. So a couple of<br />
examples would be the videos that we’ve done. We made this video in 2008<br />
and 2009 called “Entrepreneurs Can Change the World.” That was all about<br />
. . . man, do you remember when you were a kid, when you thought you could<br />
do anything, because you still can.  Right? That’s not only a message we<br />
believe in that came internally, but it’s something that people needed<br />
to hear in 2008 and 2009, when really smart people were losing their jobs.<br />
Last year, man, we created a video www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>called, “The New Dork, Entrepreneur’s State of Mind,” and that was<br />
a spoof on the Jay-Z and Alicia Keys song, and the reason we did that was<br />
because I am a huge dork, man. Like, I’m geeky, knowing how to code, doing<br />
all that stuff. That’s cool now, right? That’s like a real valuable<br />
trait in our industry. That was kind of the message that our entrepreneurs<br />
can relate to, and that’s important.  Even more recently, we petitioned<br />
to President Obama to have November 19th be National Entrepreneur’s Day,<br />
and that was actually recognized by the White House.  That doesn’t help<br />
our sales, but that’s our way of getting involved in the entrepreneurial<br />
community and doing things that our customers can relate to us with. It makes<br />
us more real.  Paul: Okay. Now, this is all interesting stuff, but how does<br />
this actually affect your bottom line?</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>Jonathan: Yeah, I touched on it before. It’s as simple as this, man.<br />
At the end of the day, you and your competitors, your feature sets will be<br />
the same. The pricing will be the same. But people take out their wallet<br />
for people that they feel comfortable with. So by putting a real face, a<br />
real human who cares behind a brand, it really just makes people feel more<br />
comfortable working with us.</p>
<p>per guy, he does something with phones, and they’ll search Grasshopper<br />
phone. That cost us $0.79, $0.80, versus an 800 number which is costing us $7<br />
or $8. So, in 2009, before we really created this wordof-mouth marketing, this<br />
Buzz Department, we were having a very large percentage of our payper-click<br />
ads were non-branded terms, product specific. Ever since we started to get<br />
out there and do all these things to build brand Paul: Okay. Now, you showed<br />
me a recognition, our brand story, our slide earlier here, where you tripled<br />
perception, that number that you something. What was that?  were talking about<br />
tripled. That means that many more people Jonathan: Yeah, it’s awesome,<br />
man. were searching for branded terms <span class="caps">PPC</span>, our pay-per-click ads, we have<br />
that were costing us 1/8 or 1/9 of branded terms and product-spethe price.<br />
cific terms. Just to give you a really quick example, a product-specific<br />
Paul: Okay. So this isn’t just fluff term would be an 800 number,<br />
stuff. You have hard data saying voicemail, toll-free number, things this<br />
stuff works.  like that. Branded terms are Grasshopper, Grasshopper phone,<br />
Grass- Jonathan: We’re talking saving my hopper phone number, things like<br />
company significantly more money that. So someone could hear me, than they<br />
pay me.  and they could be that Grasshopwww.appsumo.com</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>Paul: Great. Let’s get started. Now, let’s start with the ground rules<br />
here. What should a good brand even try to accomplish?  Jonathan: Yeah, so a<br />
couple things, man. One, you want to be memorable, and you can be memorable<br />
in a whole bunch of different ways.  But what I’ll talk about is just being<br />
unique. It’s important to learn from people who have done things really<br />
well in the past. But learn from those, and then take your own chances and<br />
try your own things and be your own brand. Don’t necessarily just try and<br />
repeat what someone else has already done.  That’s not memorable. That’s<br />
just kind of being the ambulance chasers, if you will.  Another one would be<br />
you have to be easy to relate to. It’s kind of this big company syndrome,<br />
right?  It’s really hard for people to relate to Microsoft and these huge<br />
companies. It’s like a lot of us out there we’re running small businesses<br />
and www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>we’re doing business with other people, like people doing business with<br />
people. So, it’s like how can your brand story relate to your customer? For<br />
us at Grasshopper, at least, we’re just entrepreneurs ourselves trying to<br />
create a product and service for entrepreneurs.  Back when we were talking<br />
about the “Entrepreneurs Can Change the World” video, we didn’t have<br />
to outsource any of that because that’s who we are. One thing that was so<br />
great about that is our customers and our influencers and people who follow<br />
us felt like they could relate to what we were saying and that was a real,<br />
genuine internal message. That translates into a lot of things. The copy<br />
on your website, how you interact with your customers, just try and relate<br />
with your customers on a real person-to-person level.  Paul: Okay. How do<br />
we do that?  Are there guidelines you use, or you just say for your specific<br />
industry you know your customers, like 5</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>don’t just be a robot to them, be an that you need to listen to your<br />
cusactual person.  tomers, and you need to be in the same places that your<br />
customers Jonathan: Yeah. I think it’s two are, and learn from them and<br />
unthings, man. You just touched derstand who they are. By doing on one of<br />
them. It’s this idea that that, it will help you relate to them you can be<br />
both professional and a little bit more. It’s like, from a lot personal<br />
at the same time. I think of time and a lot of experience, our founder,<br />
David Hauser, @dh man, we realize that our customers on Twitter, he does a<br />
really good are very similar to the employees job of that. I don’t even<br />
know how that we hire. We specifically hire he continues to be married to his<br />
entrepreneurial people and paswife, because I’m convinced he’s sionate<br />
people for that reason, tweeting to new customers under actually.  the table<br />
at dinner every night, being like, thank you for signing Paul: Okay. We also<br />
talked earlier, up. If you go and look, he’s the just before this interview,<br />
about founder of our company, and he being risky. How does that play tweets<br />
about cycling and all these into this?  weird things that go on in his life.<br />
He also tweets real things, and he Jonathan: Yeah, no one likes borwelcomes<br />
customers. It’s just that ing, run of the mill things. It’s why line -<br />
be who you are. Don’t try and girls and people gossip about cebe someone<br />
else because you feel lebrities. It’s provocative, interestlike you have<br />
to be. People want ing, because it’s not normal, and to know the person<br />
behind the there’s something there. Believe it brand.  or not, that’s a<br />
human instinct, like it or not. That translates to startI think the second<br />
thing there is ups. So, oftentimes, you just have www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>to take a chance. We mailed 25,000 chocolate-covered grasshoppers out to 5,000<br />
of the most influential people in the U.S. We sent them to every senator,<br />
every house of representative, and the president. We got multiple calls from<br />
Homeland Security, like, why are you targeting all of our senators and why<br />
are you sending them chocolate covered grasshoppers? Because they open all<br />
their mail. The point is we tried a lot of things before that.  Our test was:<br />
“Is this something that you would go home and tell your wife? Would you<br />
go tell your roommate this? Would you go tell your friend this? Everyday<br />
things, they don’t solve that. You have to be a little weird. You have<br />
to take a chance. Most of the things that you really find memorable to<br />
you were different. Someone took a chance.  You need to do that with your<br />
brand as well.  Paul: Okay. Now, how does a small startup do that? I mean,<br />
you guys had some marketing muscle to do www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>something crazy and audacious like that. How do we scale that down for a<br />
company that’s just bootstrapped, and really trying to make it?  Jonathan:<br />
Right. There’s no cut and dried answer. The best thing I can say is that<br />
your time is your currency when you’re a startup. If you don’t have<br />
marketing dollars, it means that you need to invest more of your time. I’ll<br />
give you an example. South by Southwest, unbelievably difficult to make a<br />
splash at South by Southwest, because there are 40,000 people there, people<br />
doing ridiculous shit every minute of every day for an entire week. Maybe<br />
you can’t even afford a ticket, because they’re $1,500 to $2,000. What<br />
we did was for Chargify, one of our companies, we rented a mascot costume<br />
that looked just like our bull. It cost us $1,000. We even hired someone to<br />
dress up in that costume. I rented a matador costume for $100, and we ran<br />
around South by Southwest 7</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>for five days, yelling, “Toro, toro,” engaging with people, having<br />
conversations with people, talking about our brand. We didn’t by a ticket. I<br />
think you can look at this picture, but we ended up getting kicked out by<br />
the police at the end of the day because they had asked us to leave so many<br />
times because the sponsors and the brands that were paying $10,000 to have<br />
a little table were pissed and were complaining because we were getting more<br />
face time, more value from the people that were there than these people that<br />
paid all this money. It was because we were creative. We invested our time,<br />
our sweat equity. So, there are things that you can do with your energy and<br />
your time to make a splash.  I don’t know what it is, because it has to<br />
fit your brand. But if you don’t have the money, invest your time.</p>
<p>pitching their customer service as this is why you should go with us.<br />
You had an interesting point, there.  What was that?</p>
<p>Jonathan: A lot of the times people are like . . . we’ll use an example like<br />
Zappos. I kind of hate these examples like Zappos and Facebook and Google,<br />
because that’s not the norm. That’s not even 1%.  That’s like one<br />
millionth of one percent. So Zappos made their name because of customer<br />
service, but that’s not common. Customer service does not equal word<br />
of mouth, and that’s what we were talking about. So, at Grasshopper,<br />
our average customer pays us $30, $35, $40 a month. Do you know what they<br />
get for that? They get a product that works. They get a U.S.  based customer<br />
support team that any day of the week, 24/7, on New Year’s at 2:00 a.m. will<br />
answer their call and help them with any probPaul: Okay. Now, another thing<br />
that lem that they have. That is what we had talked about before this in-<br />
they get for paying us money evterview was that some people are ery month,<br />
for consciously decidwww.appsumo.com</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>ing every month they want to continue to pay us money. If we don’t provide<br />
a product that works and customer service, they’re going to go to someone<br />
else who does. So, word of mouth is all those things, Paul, that you do<br />
outside of your brand, outside of just providing that service, because that<br />
is what people pay you money for. Word of mouth and wowing people is what<br />
you do outside of that.</p>
<p>going to help me solve that.  Paul: Now, how do you determine, so let’s say<br />
I put a $2, $3 app on the App Store. Their level of support has to go down,<br />
compared to like say a $50 a month product. How do you scale that?</p>
<p>Jonathan: Absolutely. But I think the interesting point there is that you<br />
don’t really, necessarily care if you lose a $2 customer. That’s a Paul:<br />
Got it. So that’s a baseline, like quantity play. At Grasshopper, yes,<br />
you have to have it. It’s not part of we have 40,000 customers, but your<br />
promotion. That’s just some- word of mouth is massive for us.  thing you<br />
have to have.  We get a lot of repeat business. If someone’s business<br />
closes down, Jonathan: You don’t have a compa- when they start a business<br />
again ny otherwise, because, at the end they come back to us. We get 35%<br />
of the day, there’s someone else to 40% of our signups from someout there<br />
who provides a similar one who says they heard about us product that will<br />
provide me with from a friend, a colleague, or a famcustomer service and a<br />
product ily member. That is a large part of that works, for a similar price<br />
point. our business. That is why it’s such a It’s like, if I’m paying<br />
you money core function.  every month, I need a product that works. I need<br />
someone who is car- If you have 100,000 downloads ing and kind and helpful,<br />
who is that people are paying you $0.99 www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>for, and a small percentage of those needed customer support that you can’t<br />
offer, maybe in that scenario it’s cheaper to lose those customers than<br />
to provide the support. I won’t claim to know that, because that’s not<br />
my expertise. I don’t have the experience there.  But that’s a different<br />
business model. You’re playing a quantity game, not necessarily a quality<br />
game.  There’s not a service aspect to that.  Does that make sense? Do<br />
you agree with that, actually?</p>
<p>Jonathan: And by the way, I think there’s a difference between paying<br />
a one-time price and deciding .  . . you know what I said a couple of<br />
minutes ago, they consciously decide to pay us money every single month. If<br />
you pay a dollar and your app doesn’t work, no matter how big or small<br />
the company is they have a responsibility to put out a bug fix, or allow<br />
you to get your money back and re-download the application. But that SaaS<br />
model, you are making a decision every month to pay us money. So you Paul:<br />
I think I do. It’s not easy to deserve to have that service. I think just<br />
have that $1 cost and expect that one-time purchase, rather, if I to have<br />
the same level of support go to Williams Sonoma and I buy that say like a<br />
Grasshopper or Zap- a $50 pot, I deserve to make sure pos would have. I guess<br />
I was just that one-time experience is posiinterested in how you adjust that,<br />
tive. They should not have to help because not all startups are going me with<br />
that pot every month. So I to fall under the same category as think it’s a<br />
little different.  Grasshopper.  Paul: In this section we talk about Jonathan:<br />
Absolutely not.  things that aren’t directly related to our business, but<br />
they still increase Paul: So are there things. . .  our bottom line. Jonathan,<br />
what are we learning about in this secwww.appsumo.com</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>tion?</p>
<p>to actually go do a test, shit, they’re going to go to KISSmetrics,<br />
beJonathan: It’s really how can you cause they remember reading this be a<br />
thought leader? How can tweet or reading this blog post you be an expert in<br />
a space, and that really taught them something again, referencing something<br />
we about testing from these guys. So, talked about earlier, Paul, how can if<br />
they’re going to actually do an you make people feel comfortable A/B test,<br />
why not work with them?  with your brand? The worst thing, So it’s way<br />
to stay in someone’s whenever someone feels confused, mind, add value to<br />
someone bethey leave. Most of the time anger fore they even engage with you<br />
as is out of confusion. How can you a product and become that expert, make<br />
someone feel comfortable become that thought leader.  with your brand? One<br />
spectacular example, if you don’t mind me div- Paul: Okay. Now how does<br />
a starting into it, is the guys over at <span class="caps">KISS</span>- up actually do that? Using<br />
them metrics, right, Neil and Hiten. They as an example, pull out the things<br />
have become the absolute thought that they’ve done that made them leaders<br />
in testing. Hash tag testing the thought leader in their space?  is like<br />
their hash tag. It’s unbelievable, because they have probably Jonathan:<br />
When they invest their 30,000 or 40,000 people who read time. Kind of what<br />
we were gotheir blog just to learn about test- ing through, talking about<br />
a little ing and statistics and follow them bit earlier. Hiten, he goes<br />
around on Twitter. I don’t even think they to a lot of conferences, and<br />
he have that many customers. It’s be- speaks for free. He just goes and<br />
cause they are the thought leader. shares real data. He opens up real So,<br />
when anyone in the industry data about his company, shares thinks testing<br />
and they then have real experiences, is quick to say, “I www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>f****d up,” and then give a lesson in learning. Being open like that<br />
and sharing real data on their blog and going out of his way to spend time<br />
tweeting observations and engaging with people about testing. If you tweet<br />
him, he responds. He has 40,000 people or so who follow him, and he responds,<br />
because he understands that investing that time, although it doesn’t make<br />
him money today or tomorrow, when you need to do a test, you go with them<br />
because it’s familiar. So investing that time to really engage with people,<br />
have a conversation, share real data, share real examples, open up the books,<br />
that goes a long way.  Paul: Do you have another company that we could use<br />
as a case study?</p>
<p>lutely irrelevant in what I’m about to say. He does a good job with his<br />
personal brand by making himself very relatable to the common American. I’ll<br />
give you an example.  Every single year in the month of March something magical<br />
happens. March madness happens. For all of you who don’t know what that is,<br />
one, shame on you. Two, it is the largest <span class="caps">NCAA</span> basketball tournament ever. It<br />
is so big that work productivity goes down. This is a fact. Google this. Work<br />
productivity goes down when this is on, because you can live stream the games<br />
and they’re during work.  People who don’t gamble, gamble on this. They<br />
put money in pools.  They throw out brackets. They follow teams that they’ve<br />
never even heard of, and again, work productivity goes down. That is how<br />
many people are engaged in March Madness.</p>
<p>Jonathan: Absolutely, and it’s not a company. Believe it or not, it’s our<br />
president. It’s funny, and I just want to preface this by saying you Paul:<br />
Huge amount.  can hate Obama to death. It’s absowww.appsumo.com</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>Jonathan: It’s a huge amount. It’s just ridiculous, right? The point<br />
I’m trying to make is that Obama, the only president who does this, has<br />
ever done this, he fills out a presidential bracket, and they put it on the<br />
front page of <span class="caps">ESPN</span>, which gets hundreds of millions of views. So it’s like<br />
hate him or love him, your president is doing something that an unbelievable,<br />
ungodly percentage of the United States is also doing. So it makes someone<br />
who’s so hard to ever imagine talking to or seeing or being able to relate<br />
to, it makes him relatable. It makes him reachable. It makes him human.  Paul:<br />
Yeah, so, it has nothing to do with his presidency. It’s just he’s trying<br />
to connect with people.  Jonathan: Yeah. So someone, who knows nothing about<br />
any political topics, the average person is not super engaged in politics,<br />
but they know little things like this.  It makes them feel more comfortable<br />
having a president who www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>does something that they do. He plays basketball like they do. Versus<br />
someone who is staunch and just wears suits and does all these things. You<br />
know what I’m saying?  It just makes him real. It makes someone who’s<br />
so hard to imagine that’s real, human, and that goes a long way.  Paul:<br />
Okay. So startups can do that same thing with their customers.  Jonathan:<br />
Right. Just learn who your audience is. Find out what they’re doing. Be<br />
in the same places as them. Do the same things that they do.  Paul: Okay. So<br />
step one would be identifying your target customer, right?  Jonathan: Yeah,<br />
let’s be real. You’re probably not making any money if you don’t know<br />
who your target customer is.  Paul: Okay. You take your target 13</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>customer and you find like some common denominators there, and you go after<br />
those things.</p>
<p>He runs a company called Flowtown, and he’s pivoted a couple times. But he<br />
does this thing called gift marketing. He’s essentially Jonathan: Well,<br />
talk to them. Every found a really scalable way to give once in a while,<br />
when someone gifts and little boxes of happiness tweets you about your brand,<br />
hop via Twitter and Facebook. He’s on the phone with them. Spend 20 found a<br />
way to make that easy for minutes; listen to their story. Find you to do. You<br />
don’t have to have places, like what I said about Hiten anything. You can<br />
pay him a little Shah, he goes to events. He’s real. bit of money, a very<br />
reasonable You can meet him. Go to places amount of money, and he’s still<br />
where your community is. Show up on beta, but it’s worth checking in person.<br />
it out. He can handle this whole process for you. So, if you want to Paul:<br />
Got it. Any other examples?  send someone cookies, he knows someone who does<br />
that. So he Jonathan: Yeah, I really want to handles the logistics part<br />
for you, leave you guys with an actionable which would be time consuming.<br />
item that you can take away from So the action item is find a way to this<br />
section. It actually correlates wow someone. Find a way to really with an<br />
example, if you don’t mind knock someone on their ass, and me kind of<br />
putting those two tojust surprise someone. Be a little gether.  memorable.<br />
Paul: Absolutely.  Jonathan: There’s this really spectacular entrepreneur,<br />
Dan Martell.  www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>So what I’m challenging you to do is find something that takes you under<br />
five minutes and costs you less than $15 per customer. I’ll give 14</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>you an example. We recently had one of our customers who has a very small<br />
blog give us a huge shot on his blog. I took out a thank you card. I wrote<br />
him a handwritten note, and just said, “Hey, man.  Word of mouth is a big<br />
part of our business, and I just really appreciate you taking the time to<br />
give us a shout out. We’re listening, and it just means a lot to us.”<br />
Handwritten note, and I gave him a $5 Starbucks gift card. With postage, with<br />
the handwritten note, and the $5 gift card, it probably cost me $7 or $8,<br />
three or four minutes of my time.  This guy probably he literally started<br />
peeing his pants, he was so . . .  Paul: Literally?  Jonathan: Literally,<br />
I think he started peeing in his pants because he was just so excited. No<br />
one had ever done that for him. Not only did he write about us again, but<br />
he talks about us now. He’s never going to go to a competitor who offers<br />
the same thing, or has one www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>more feature than us, because we’re real to him. I’m a real person to<br />
him. I wrote him a handwritten note.  Paul: Right. Okay. So, you’re showing,<br />
again, like your personal side.  You’re getting your claws in customers<br />
just by being nice.  Jonathan: Yeah, it’s like, if you own a company or<br />
you work for someone, I challenge you that 5 minutes and $7.50 isn’t worth<br />
retaining a customer for multiple more months. That’s real. You have to<br />
think time investment versus what you’re getting out of it, and if you could<br />
sit there all day and just do that, you would probably be more profitable by<br />
increasing all that customer retention.  Paul: Right. Their long-term value.<br />
Jonathan: Oh, absolutely, lifetime value of the customer is serious.  Paul:<br />
Now, let’s talk about build15</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>ing buzz and some PR stuff as well.  Building buzz almost sounds qualitative<br />
to me. Are there actual metrics to this? What are we supposed to be measuring<br />
to know if we’re successful in creating buzz?</p>
<p>because of the things that the Buzz Department does, and the amount of time<br />
we would waste trying to track and measure that would actually not allow<br />
us to do our jobs.  So what we realized pretty early is that there’s<br />
a leap of faith, on some Jonathan: It’s a mix, and I think level. The<br />
management, the foundthat’s the important thing to reers, they need to<br />
buy into the fact member. Things we measure are that word of mouth is real,<br />
and that mentions. That’s the biggest met- by doing good things and by<br />
putric. A mention is something like ting good things out there, they this,<br />
being on a radio spot, having will come back around. It’s kind a customer<br />
link to you on a blog of ironic, because this interview post. A mention<br />
is anywhere some- is actually a spectacular example one is talking about<br />
you based on of that. I’m getting general brand a relationship that you<br />
cultivated. awareness for Grasshopper, my company, and it’s based on<br />
relaPaul: Okay.  tionships that I’ve cultivated from meeting people and<br />
building buzz Jonathan: We measure things like that even allowed me to key<br />
note branded search terms. The graph tonight at Seattle Startup Riot, that<br />
we showed you earlier, that’s knowing you and Noah Kagan, real money that<br />
we’re saving from and be doing this video. That only branding activities,<br />
like building came from relationships through buzz. That’s absolutely<br />
important. building buzz.  But at the end of the day, there are things that<br />
you can’t measure. Paul: Okay. How would you actuThere are customers that<br />
sign up ally do that, if you’re starting from www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>scratch? Like, how do you build those relationships? Is it just showing up? Is<br />
there like a formula that you try to follow, or guidelines you try to follow?</p>
<p>going to burn out in 2020, and the world is probably going to end in<br />
2020, as well. They can only write about one or two of those press<br />
releases. Logistically, that’s it. They come in to their desk, Paul,<br />
knowJonathan: Yeah, that’s a fair quesing that they’re going to have<br />
to tion. Sorry for being vague. There say no 98% of the time, no matter<br />
is no formula. The bottom line is how well written it is, no matter that<br />
the advice that I give you only how many stupid buzz terms you helps your<br />
chances. You’re still go- use, no matter how cool or innovaing to fail in<br />
terms of PR and buzz tive your product is, they’re going a good percentage<br />
of the time.  to say no 98% of the time.  You’ve got to give yourself a<br />
fighting chance. That’s what all this is Paul: Okay. So, how do we beat<br />
about. Watching all these videos, those odds?  that’s what that’s about -<br />
giving yourself the best fighting chance. Jonathan: Right. So then you have<br />
the staff reporter. He gets in at So, a couple of quick things. First, 7:00<br />
a.m. This person doesn’t know I’d like to just give you an example what<br />
they’re going to write about of a really traditional agency, tratoday. They<br />
are looking to be inditional media outlet. You have an spired, because they<br />
know that at editor, and you have a general staff 10:00 a.m. they’re going<br />
to go sit in reporter. The editor comes in about a meeting with their boss and<br />
all 9:00 a.m. They probably have a their colleagues, and they’re gostack<br />
of 95 press releases on their ing to have to pitch an idea. So it desks. 94<br />
of the 95 press releases becomes find a way to inspire the could say that<br />
the sun is probably staff reporter. Find a way to learn www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>about them. Make a real, human interaction with them. Help them do their job,<br />
and then they will pitch to their editor for you. You better believe that<br />
the editor is going to be much more likely to listen to the staff reporter,<br />
who they’re paying $60,000 or $70,000 a year, than some piece of paper<br />
that’s on their desk when they come in that they know they’ll have to<br />
say no to.  So that’s a general example, but it translates.</p>
<p>her blog posts, because how can you reach out to someone without reading<br />
their “about”’ page, without reading their blog posts, without learning<br />
about them? You’re just the same asshole who writes the press release.<br />
Paul: Right. So you have to invest that initial time in the relationship.</p>
<p>Jonathan: You have to be human.  You have to learn something. Find a common<br />
ground. So Stephanie So let me give you a real live exam- read the post that<br />
Carol wrote ple. There’s a woman called Carol about how someone offered her<br />
Tice. She writes for Entrepreneur.  $35 to write blog post. She was com. One<br />
of my colleagues that so insulted because her time was works with me, named<br />
Stephaworth so much more money than nie, wanted to reach out to her, that. Dumb<br />
luck as it sounds, because she writes for EntrepreStephanie had someone<br />
kind of neur.com. That’s great coverage.  do the same thing to her. So she<br />
Stephanie spent 15 or 20 minutes reached out to Carol, and she researching,<br />
stalking, whatever you didn’t start off by saying, “Hey, I’m want to<br />
say, learning about Carol.  the ambassador of buzz at GrassShe found out that<br />
Carol had her hopper. Let me tell you about own blog, CarolTice.com. We’re<br />
not this.” She said, “Carol, I was reading stretching here. You know<br />
what your blog and I can’t believe that I’m saying? She read five or<br />
six of someone insulted you by offering www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>you $35 for a post. The same thing happened to me.” She immediately created a<br />
real human personal connection. What that did was that bought her 45 seconds<br />
of time, because she gets a lot of emails, and none of them start off like<br />
that. Then, she actually read what Stephanie had to say realized that it<br />
was interesting and relevant, and within seven days of that, we got a link<br />
on Entrepreneur.com, and that translates. Maybe it’s not this blog post<br />
idea. Maybe this person likes water skiing, and your best friend loves water<br />
skiing. Find a real human connection and immediately highlight that.</p>
<p>a half years, I think we’ve literally gotten a press mention every other day,<br />
and that’s something like 500+ press mentions. Those were mentions that were<br />
trackable to a relationship that someone in the Buzz Department cultivated.<br />
Paul: Now, I really think this is key.  Can you give us another example of<br />
how this works out and actually plays out in real life?</p>
<p>Jonathan: Absolutely, man. I have a real quick, kind of powerful one for<br />
you. There was this guy at C-Net. I pitched him very out of the blue, and he<br />
had simply written a bunch of articles that say, “Technology Paul: You’ve<br />
used these exact same that helps me do my job.” I reached principles to get<br />
Grasshopper in out to him and said, “Hey, we work the group every other day<br />
in the here at Grasshopper. We’d love to press. Like, I don’t know if we<br />
talk- connect you with our founder and ed about that earlier or not, but <span class="caps">CTO</span><br />
to just talk about some of the how many times was that over the technology<br />
that he uses.” Dumb last what, two years? Every other luck, whatever it<br />
was, maybe he day?  recognized the brand, but he’s like, “Yeah, we’d<br />
absolutely loved to Jonathan: Yeah, in the last two and hook you up.” So,<br />
ended up doing a www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>piece. He ended up writing about David Hauser. He emailed me the day the<br />
piece went live and said, “Here it is.” I said, “Hey, man, like, you<br />
know. . .” Instead of just saying thanks for the coverage and ending the<br />
relationship, I sent him a little different email. “Take a look and read for<br />
yourself.” But I just said, “Thank you. This means a lot to us. I really<br />
appreciate it. Listen, I happen to know a lot of different entrepreneurs and<br />
small business owners. If there’s ever anything I could do to help or make<br />
a connection for you, it would absolutely be my pleasure. It’s the least I<br />
could do in return.” He responded and said, “Yeah, feel free to make an<br />
introduction for me.” So I end up introducing him to our friends over at<br />
LessAccounting.com, who are partners of ours. They’re customers of ours<br />
and they send us a lot of business. So I ended up introducing Alan Branch<br />
over there with this guy at C- Net, and he ended up writing about Alan. So<br />
I was able to do a favor for a customer, a partner, www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>and a brand loyalist, and all it took was just asking a question, showing<br />
that I cared, and that I wanted to help.  This is the craziest thing. Look<br />
at this email that he sent me back, right now. “Thank you for helping me<br />
do my job.” No, C-Net blogger, thank you for covering my partner and my<br />
customer. Again, it’s this win-win situation. Help reporters.  Help people<br />
in the media do their job, and you go from being someone who’s self-serving<br />
to someone who they want to respond to, whose email they want to read. I just<br />
think that’s really powerful.  Paul: Yeah, and you’re also going to bat<br />
for your customer, and they’ve got to appreciate that as well.  Jonathan:<br />
Right. That’s where that 35% to 40% of signups via word of mouth comes from,<br />
doing a lot of things like that.  Paul: Got it. All right. Now let’s say 20</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>we followed all these principles and we have a viable brand online. It’s<br />
great. Our customers love us. We’re going to bat for them.  They’re<br />
talking, referring their friends.  Jonathan: This feels great.  Paul: Things<br />
are going well, like we’re generally well liked, at least in our market. How<br />
do we convert this to actual cash? How do we increase our bottom line?</p>
<p>a product. People like to share something of value with people that they care<br />
about, and that’s on you. If you’re not creating a product that adds<br />
value, you’re probably not going to succeed, and there’s no successful<br />
entrepreneur out there that can teach you anything that’s going to help<br />
that. You need to create a product of value.</p>
<p>The second thing is people refer companies where they know someone, and I<br />
don’t mean know someone like my brother or my Jonathan: I think it’s<br />
a couple girlfriend or my best friend works things. The first thing I want<br />
to there. I mean, I heard Jonathan Kay say is there are a couple real reaon<br />
Startup Riot. I had a beer with sons why someone decides to David Hauser. I met<br />
Noah Kagan refer your brand. Why someone at so and so. That’s what it means.<br />
actually talks to their friend and They know someone. There’s a face says,<br />
“Hey, you need to check out and a name and some real person Grasshopper. You<br />
need to go sign they can put behind the brand, up for apps. You have to read<br />
The- and that makes them want to talk StartupFoundry.com.” There’s a rea-<br />
about you. It makes someone want son when someone does that. So, to refer you,<br />
and it’s that referral, a really successful marketer once that’s what<br />
converts to money.  taught me there are two reasons.  Word of mouth converts<br />
it 20%.  One is because people like to share That is a fact.  www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>tweets you or you’re having a conPaul: That’s insanely hot. What does<br />
versation with someone and they a website convert at?  recommend something<br />
to you, make a note and follow up with Jonathan: Websites convert at 1%<br />
that person. How often does that or 1.5%. I mean, our website goes happen,<br />
that someone says, “You from 1.3% to 1.4% or 1.5%. If you know, I really<br />
wish you guys would were to convert at 1.6% or 1.7%, create a mobile app,”<br />
and you actuwe could all take a vacation for ally follow up with that.<br />
literally months. It would be insane. Word of mouth converts it Let’s be<br />
clear. I’m not saying de20%, and that means that you can velop a mobile app<br />
because of that invest that much more time in uti- person. But I’m saying<br />
if you can’t lizing those relationships, because develop the mobile app,<br />
you better it is that viable of a method to get call that person back and say,<br />
“Hey, sales. So get out there. That’s why I appreciate the feedback. It<br />
makes we’re telling you to do all these perfect sense, but here’s why<br />
we things, because it converts, guys.  can’t do that.” I’ve created<br />
raving fans by literally telling someone One good example would be, you that<br />
I couldn’t create a feature that hear a lot of people saying, “Listen<br />
they asked for, but I took the time to your customers,” Paul. Listen to<br />
tell them why. I showed them to your customers, get feedback.  that I went<br />
to someone. I went to This whole lean startup movesomeone in the hierarchy in<br />
the ment right now is listen to your company, went to bat for them, customers<br />
and try and develop and here’s why it won’t happen.  what they’re<br />
telling you, if it makes Or even better, here’s why it can’t sense. So,<br />
what I would challenge happen. That’s unbelievable. That’s you to do is<br />
sometimes if someone powerful.  www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>them. We’re just highlighting cool Paul: That inside look.  ass customers<br />
of ours. We’re giving them links. We’re talking about Jonathan: The<br />
inside look, and it’s their business. We’re showing them just saying,<br />
“Not only did we listen a real picture of the people that to what you said,<br />
but I care enough do that. I’ve got to tell you guys that I’m taking the<br />
time to follow we did some crazy A/B testing by up.” adding this as one of<br />
our four main tabs on our site. It absolutely killed Paul: Awesome. Jonathan,<br />
thanks conversions. Literally, conversions so much for this overview here.<br />
sky- rocketed by adding this page, We’re going to be awesome at because<br />
it allowed someone to making our customers happy relate to your brand. Oh,<br />
you guys and pulling them in. Any closing have other web design firms that<br />
thoughts for us?  have four people? That’s us. Maybe this makes sense. So<br />
I think it’s Jonathan: Yeah, so the last thing just a great way to tie in,<br />
yes, this I want to end with, and because makes you money. Making somethis<br />
an action class, I want to give one comfortable, being transparyou real<br />
examples that make real ent, and getting someone to relate money. Go to our<br />
website. Look at to someone who uses your prodour “happy customers”<br />
tab right uct, or even you and your team, now. It’s not what you think<br />
it is.  that goes a long way. That converts It’s not people talking about<br />
why to sales, guys. So, please, get crethey love Grasshopper or how they<br />
ative. Find a way to do that. Email use Grasshopper even. It’s not tes-<br />
me, jkay@grasshopper.com. Tweet timonials. There are a couple of anyone on<br />
our team. We’d be hapcompanies that are doing this real py to talk about<br />
this stuff more in well. 37signals obviously is one of depth.  www.appsumo.com</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Why Brand Perception Sells</p>
<p>Paul: Awesome. Jonathan, thanks again for your time.</p>
